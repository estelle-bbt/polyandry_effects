	abstract = {We documented effects of floral variation on seed paternity and maternal fecundity in a series ofsmall experimental populations ofwild radish, R. sativus. Each population was composed oftwo competing pollen donor groups with contrasting floral morphologies and several designated maternal plants. Progeny testing with electrophoretic markers allowed us to measure paternal success. Realized fecundity by each maternal plant and the fraction of those seeds attributable to each pollen donor group were used as outcome variables in path analysis to explore relationships between floral characters (petal size, pollen grain number per flower, and modal pollen grain size), pollinator visitation patterns, and reproductive success. A wide range of pollinator taxa visited the experimental populations, and patterns ofdiscrimination appeared to vary among them. The impact of visitation on male and female reproduction also varied among taxa; visits of small native bees significantly increased paternal success, while those ofhoney bees reduced male fitness. Only visits by large native bees had discernible effects on recipient fecundity, and, overall, fecundity was not limited by visitation. Maternal plants bearing large-petalled flowers produced fewer flowers during the experiment, reducing their total seed production. In these small populations, postpollination processes (at least in part, compatibility) significantly influenced male and female reproductive success. Variation in pollinator pools occurring on both spatial and temporal scales may act to preserve genetic variation for floral traits in this species.},

	title = {Sperm competition and its evolutionary consequences in the insects},
	isbn = {978-0-691-05988-4},
	abstract = {One hundred years after Darwin considered how sexual selection shapes the behavioral and morphological characteristics of males for acquiring mates, Parker realized that sexual selection continues after mating through sperm competition. Because females often mate with multiple males before producing offspring, selection favors adaptations that allow males to preempt sperm from previous males and to prevent their own sperm from preemption by future males. Since the 1970s, this area of research has seen exponential growth, and biologists now recognize sperm competition as an evolutionary force that drives such adaptations as mate guarding, genital morphology, and ejaculate chemistry across all animal taxa. The insects have been critical to this research, and they still offer the greatest potential to reveal fully the evolutionary consequences of sperm competition. This book analyzes and extends thirty years of theoretical and empirical work on insect sperm competition. It considers both male and female interests in sperm utilization and the sexual conflict that can arise when these differ. It covers the mechanics of sperm transfer and utilization, morphology, physiology, and behavior. Sperm competition is shown to have dramatic effects on adaptation in the context of reproduction as well as far-reaching ramifications on life-history evolution and speciation. Written by a top researcher in the field, this comprehensive, up-to-date review of the evolutionary causes and consequences of sperm competition in the insects will prove an invaluable reference for students and established researchers in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology.},

We investigated habitat differentiation between and within sites in the fully cross-fertile and hybridizing Silene dioica and S. latifolia using ampliﬁed fragment length polymorphisms (AFLP) proﬁles and corresponding vegetation releve´ s around individual plants. Nineteen study sites in the Swiss Alps included pure sites and contact sites (both taxa present within 30 m). In pure sites and at contact sites, the two taxa showed consistently differentiated AFLP banding patterns across regions but few discriminating bands. This indicates that although the two taxa are weakly differentiated, current introgression has not led to genome-wide admixture. Only three putative early generation hybrids were detected at contact sites. The habitats of the two taxa differed between pure sites with S. dioica occurring in moister, colder, and less-disturbed sites than S. latifolia. However, asymmetric habitat overlap was evident within contact sites found in intermediate conditions that were more similar to S. latifolia sites. This situation might favor introgression from S. dioica into S. latifolia. Evidence for habitat–genotype associations within contact sites was weak making habitat-mediated selection against intermediate phenotypes of hybrids unlikely in the contact sites investigated. We suggest that other reproductive barriers together with dispersal limitation contribute to the rarity of early generation hybrids.},

	abstract = {Pollinators may mediate selection on traits affecting pollinator attraction and effectiveness, and while nonadditive effects of traits inﬂuencing the two components of pollination success are expected when seed production is pollen limited, they have been little studied. In a factorial design, we manipulated one putative attraction trait (number of ﬂowers) and one putative efﬁciency trait (spur length) previously shown to be subject to pollinatormediated selection in the deceptive orchid Dactylorhiza lapponica. Removal of half of the ﬂowers reduced pollen removal, proportion of ﬂowers receiving pollen, fruit set, and fruit mass compared to unmanipulated plants, while spur-tip removal increased fruit set and fruit mass but did not affect pollen removal or proportion of ﬂowers receiving pollen. The effect of spurtip removal on fruit mass was stronger among plants with intact number of ﬂowers compared to plants with experimentally reduced number of ﬂowers. The results demonstrate that number of ﬂowers and spur length are direct targets of selection and may affect female ﬁtness nonadditively. More generally, they show that the adaptive value of a given trait can depend on ﬂoral context and illustrate how experimental approaches can advance our understanding of the evolution of trait combinations.},

	abstract = {Successful biological invaders often exhibit enhanced performance following introduction to a new region. The traditional explanation for this phenomenon is that natural enemies (e.g., competitors, pathogens, and predators) present in the native range are absent from the introduced range. The purpose of this study was to test the escape-from-enemy hypothesis using the perennial plant Silene latifolia as a model system. This European native was introduced to North America in the 1800s and subsequently spread to a large part of the continent. It is now considered a problematic weed of disturbed habitats and agricultural ﬁelds in the United States and Canada. Surveys of 86 populations in the United States and Europe revealed greater levels of attack by generalist enemies (aphids, snails, ﬂoral herbivores) in Europe compared with North America. Two specialists (seed predator, anther smut fungus) that had dramatic effects on plant ﬁtness in Europe were either absent or in very low frequency in North America. Overall, plants were 17 times more likely to be damaged in Europe than in North America. Thus, S. latifolia’s successful North American invasion can, at least in part, be explained by escape from specialist enemies and lower levels of damage following introduction.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Phenylacetaldehyde is a ﬂower volatile and attractant for many nectar-seeking moths. Acetic acid is a microbial fermentation product that is present in insect sweet baits. It is weakly attractive to some moths and other insects, but can be additive or synergistic with other compounds to make more powerful insect lures. RESULTS: Acetic acid and phenylacetaldehyde presented together in traps made a stronger lure than either chemical alone for moths of the alfalfa looper Autographa californica (Speyer) and the armyworm Spodoptera albula (Walker). However, this combination of chemicals reduced captures of the cabbage looper moth Trichoplusia ni (Hu¨ bner), the silver Y moth Autographa gamma (L.), MacDunnoughia confusa (Stephens) and the soybean looper moth Chrysodeixis includens (Walker) by comparison with phenylacetaldehyde alone. CONCLUSION: These results indicate both positive and negative interactions of acetic acid, a sugar fermentation odor cue, and phenylacetaldehyde, a ﬂoral scent cue, in eliciting orientation responses of moths. This research provides a new two-component lure for the alfalfa looper A. californica and for the armyworm S. albula for potential use in pest management.},

This is the case of several Silene species that were viewed as nocturnally pollinated but are factually visited, and then potentially pollinated, by both nocturnal and diurnal insects. This opens the question of the consistency of pollination syndromes and the impact of different pollinator assemblages on plant reproductive success. In this work, we measured diurnal and nocturnal pollinators’ contributions to pollination success (fruit and seed production) and offspring quality (seed mass and germination rate) of hermaphrodite plants in an artificial population of Silene nutans, by experimentally restricting pollinator access and controlling for floral and resource traits. We found that fruit and seed production was higher for nocturnal pollination, and that only very few seeds were produced by diurnal visitors. In our experimental system, plants did not benefit from being open during daytime, as they showed no fruit or seed production advantage in the open pollination treatment compared to the nocturnal one. Seeds generated from diurnal pollination were heavier but did not germinate better, so that the plant fitness proxy remained higher for nocturnal pollination than diurnal one, without any obvious evidence of a pollination mixed strategy. These data are in accordance with the nocturnal pollination syndrome of S. nutans, contrasting with several other studies carried out on other Silene species.},

	abstract = {Community and biogeographic surveys often conclude that plant–pollinator interactions are highly generalized. Thus, a central implication of the pollination syndrome concept, that ﬂoral trait evolution occurs primarily via specialized interactions of plants with their pollinators, has been questioned. However, broad surveys may not distinguish whether ﬂower visitors are actual pollen vectors and hence lack power to assess the relationship between syndrome traits and the pollinators responsible for their evolution. Here we address whether the ﬂoral traits of three closely related hermaphroditic Silene spp. native to eastern North America (S. caroliniana, S. virginica, and S. stellata) correspond to predicted specialized pollination based on ﬂoral differences among the three species and the congruence of these ﬂoral features with recognized pollination syndromes. A nocturnal/diurnal pollinator exclusion experiment demonstrated that all three Silene spp. have diurnal pollinators, and only S. stellata has nocturnal pollinators. Multiyear studies of visitation rates demonstrated that large bees, hummingbirds, and nocturnal moths were the most frequent pollinators of S. caroliniana, S. virginica, and S. stellata, respectively. Estimates of pollen grains deposited and removed per visit generally corroborated the visitation rate results for all three species. However, the relatively infrequent diurnal hawkmoth pollinators of S. caroliniana were equally effective and more efﬁcient than the most frequent large bee visitors. Pollinator importance (visitation 3 deposition) of each of the animal visitors to each species was estimated and demonstrated that in most years large bees and nocturnal moths were the most important pollinators of S. caroliniana and S. stellata, respectively. By quantifying comprehensive aspects of the pollination process we determined that S. virginica and S. stellata were specialized on hummingbirds and nocturnal moths, respectively, and S. caroliniana was the least specialized with diurnal hawkmoth and large bee pollinators. Compared across the Silene species, divergent ﬂoral character states are consistent with increasing the attraction and/or pollen transfer efﬁciency of their respective major pollinators, which suggests that the pollinators are past and/or contemporary selective agents for ﬂoral trait evolution in these three Silene species. We conclude that the pollination syndrome concept allows us to effectively relate the functional signiﬁcance of ﬂoral morphology to the major pollinators of these Silene species.},

	abstract = {Nectar-feeding animals can use vision and olfaction to ﬁnd rewarding ﬂowers and diﬀerent species may give diﬀerent weight to the two sensory modalities. We have studied how a diurnal or nocturnal lifestyle aﬀects the weight given to vision and olfaction. We tested naı¨ ve hawkmoths of two species in a wind tunnel, presenting an odour source and a visual stimulus. Although the two species belong to the same subfamily of sphingids, the Macroglossinae, their behaviour was quite diﬀerent. The nocturnal Deilephila elpenor responded preferably to the odour while the diurnal Macroglossum stellatarum strongly favoured the visual stimulus. Since a nocturnal lifestyle is ancestral for sphingids, the diurnal species, M. stellatarum, has evolved from nocturnal moths that primarily used olfaction. During bright daylight visual cues may have became more important than odour.},

	abstract = {This review outlines how eyes of terrestrial vertebrates and insects meet the competing requirements of coding both spatial and spectral information. There is no unique solution to this problem. Thus, mammals and honeybees use their long-wavelength receptors for both achromatic (luminance) and colour vision, whereas flies and birds probably use separate sets of photoreceptors for the two purposes. In particular, we look at spectral tuning and diversification among ‘long-wavelength’ receptors (sensitivity maxima at greater than 500 nm), which play a primary role in luminance vision. Data on spectral sensitivities and phylogeny of visual photopigments can be incorporated into theoretical models to suggest how eyes are adapted to coding natural stimuli. Models indicate, for example, that animal colour vision—involving five or fewer broadly tuned receptors—is well matched to most natural spectra. We can also predict that the particular objects of interest and signal-to-noise ratios will affect the optimal eye design. Nonetheless, it remains difficult to account for the adaptive significance of features such as co-expression of photopigments in single receptors, variation in spectral sensitivities of mammalian L-cone pigments and the diversification of long-wavelength receptors that has occurred in several terrestrial lineages.},

Fragrance chemistry was species-speciﬁc during nocturnal emissions, whereas odors emitted diurnally were less distinct. All species emitted greater amounts of fragrance at night, regardless of pollinator aﬃnity. However, these species diﬀered markedly in odor complexity and emission rates, even among close relatives. Species-speciﬁc diﬀerences in emission rates per ﬂower and per unit fresh or dry ﬂower mass were signiﬁcantly correlated; fragrance diﬀerences between species were not greatly aﬀected by diﬀerent forms of standardization. Flowers of hawkmoth-pollinated species emitted nitrogenous aldoximes and benzenoid esters on nocturnal rhythms. Four Nicotiana species in section Alatae sensu strictu have ﬂowers that emit large amounts of 1,8 cineole, with smaller amounts of monoterpene hydrocarbons and a-terpineol on a nocturnal rhythm. This pattern suggests the activity of a single biosynthetic enzyme (1,8 cineole synthase) with major and minor products; however, several terpene synthase enzymes could contribute to total monoterpene emissions. Our analyses, combined with other studies of tobacco volatiles, suggest that phenotypic fragrance variation in Nicotiana is shaped by pollinator- and herbivore-mediated selection, biosynthetic pathway dynamics and shared evolutionary history.},

We exposed females from artiﬁcial-selection lines (many, small ﬂowers (SF) vs. few, large ﬂowers (LF)) to this moth. Infestation did not differ signiﬁcantly between lines, but the odds of attacked fruits aborting were higher in SF females. We partitioned selection between that caused by moth attack and that resulting from all other factors. In both lines, selection via moth attack for fewer, smaller ﬂowers contrasted with selection via other factors for more ﬂowers. In LF females, selection via the two components was strongest and selection via moth attack also favoured increased fruit abortion. This suggests that the moths act as more of a selective force on ﬂower size and number via their predating than their pollinating role.},

	abstract = {What explains variation in the strength of sexual selection across species, populations or differences between the sexes? Here, we show that unifying two well-known lines of thinking provides the necessary conceptual framework to account for variation in sexual selection. The Bateman gradient and the operational sex ratio (OSR) are incomplete in complementary ways: the former describes the ﬁtness gain per mating and the latter the potential difﬁculty of achieving it. We combine this insight with an analysis of the scope for sexually selected traits to spread despite naturally selected costs. We explain why the OSR sometimes does not affect the strength of sexual selection. An explanation of sexual selection becomes more logical when a long ‘dry time’ (‘time out’, recovery after mating due to e.g. parental care) is understood to reduce the expected time to the next mating when in the mating pool (i.e. available to mate again). This implies weaker selection to shorten the wait. An integrative view of sexual selection combines an understanding of the origin of OSR biases with how they are reﬂected in the Bateman gradient, and how this can produce selection for mate acquisition traits despite naturally selected costs.},

The role of foraging distances for the visitation rate of foraging habitats was studied by performing capture± recapture experiments with natural nests of Bombus terrestris, Bombus lapidarius and Bombus muscorum. Differences were found on the species as well as the individual level. The foraging distances of B. muscorum were more restricted to the neighbourhood of the nesting habitat than the foraging activity of B. terrestris and B. lapidarius. High percentages of B. terrestris workers were recaptured while foraging on super-abundant resources in distances up to 1750 m from the nest. Isolated patches of highly rewarding forage crops, in agricultural landscapes, are probably only accessed by bumblebee species with large mean foraging distances, such as the short-tongued B. terrestris. Species like the rare, long-tongued B. muscorum depend on a close connection between nesting and foraging habitat. A restricted foraging radius might be one important factor of bumblebee species loss and potential pollinator limitation in modern agricultural landscapes. Furthermore, long-distance ¯ights of bumblebee pollinators have to be considered in the present discussion on gene ¯ow from transgenic plant species on a landscape scale.},

	abstract = {Animals pollinate 87\% of the world’s ﬂowering plant species. Therefore, how pollinators respond to human-induced land-use change has important implications for plants and the species that depend on them. Here, we synthesize the published literature on how land-use change affects the main groups of pollinators: bees, butterﬂies, ﬂies, birds, and bats. Responses to land-use change are predominantly negative but are highly variable within and across taxa. The directionality of pollinator response varies according to study design, with comparisons across gradients in surrounding landscape cover ﬁnding largely negative responses and comparisons across local land-use types ﬁnding largely positive responses. Furthermore, among the studies using landscape designs, most were performed in systems where landuse change is extreme, and such studies ﬁnd stronger negative effects than those performed in more moderate systems. Across multiple taxa, dietary specialists show greater sensitivity to land use than do generalists. There is a need for studies of pollinator species composition and relative abundance, rather than simply species richness and aggregate abundance, to identify the species that are lost and gained with increasing land-use change.},

	abstract = {Pollination commonly limits seed production, as addition of pollen to stigmas often increases fecundity. This response is usually interpreted as evidence that plants’ stigmas receive too few pollen grains to maximize ovule fertilization (quantity limitation); however, many genetic studies demonstrate that poor-quality pollen can also reduce seed production (quality limitation). We explore both aspects of pollen limitation theoretically with a dose–response model that incorporates a saturating negative-exponential relation of seed production to pollen receipt. This relation depends on aspects of ovule production, pollen import, pollen–pistil interactions and seed development, all of which can contribute to pollen limitation. Our model reveals that quantity limitation is restricted to the lowest range of pollen receipt, for which siring success per pollen grain is high, whereas quality limitation acts throughout the range of pollen receipt if plants do not import the highest-quality pollen. In addition to pollinator availability and efﬁciency, quantity limitation is governed by all postpollination aspects of seed production. In contrast, quality limitation depends on the difference in survival of embryos sired by naturally delivered pollen vs. by pollen of maximal quality. We brieﬂy illustrate the distinction between these two components of pollen limitation with results from the mistletoe Tristerix corymbosus. Our model also shows that the standard pollen-supplementation technique neither estimates the total intensity of pollen limitation nor distinguishes between its quantity and quality components. As an alternative, we propose a methodological protocol that requires both measurement of seed production following excess pollination with only outcross pollen and quantiﬁcation of the dose–response relation of seed output to pollen receipt. This method estimates both the total extent of pollen limitation and its two components. Finally, we consider the inﬂuences on quantity and quality limitation, which reveals that quantity limitation probably occurs much less often than has been inferred from pollen-supplementation experiments. These interpretations suggest that an expanded perspective that recognizes the fecundity consequences of pollination with poor-quality pollen would promote ecological understanding of pollen limitation.},

We estimated pollinator-mediated selection through female function in L-morph (long-style and short-anther phenotype) and S-morph (short-style and long-anther phenotype) flowers among four Primula secundiflora populations with different pollinator assemblages. Variation in pollinator assemblage strongly contributed to differences in reproductive success among populations and between morphs of the primrose species. A wider corolla tube width was selected in the bumblebee-dominated populations, whereas shorter corolla tube length and wider corolla tube width were selected in the syrphid fly-dominated populations. Morph-specific variation in pollinator-mediated selection on corolla tube length was detected in the syrphid fly-dominated populations. A shorter corolla tube was selected in the L-morph flowers. However, similar selective pressure on this trait was not observed in the S-morph flowers. These results show that variation in pollinator assemblage leads to variation in selection in space and between morphs. The findings highlight the potential forces of different pollinator agents in driving floral evolution in this primrose species.},

	abstract = {Background: Rare long distance dispersal events impact the demography and the genetic structure of populations. When dispersal is modelled via a dispersal kernel, one possible characterisation of long-distance dispersal is given by the shape of the tail of the kernel, i.e. its type of decay. This characteristic is known to directly act on the speed and pattern of colonization, and on the spatial structure of genetic diversity during colonization. In particular, colonization waves behave differently depending on whether the kernel decreases faster or slower than an exponential (i.e. is thin-tailed vs. fat-tailed). To interpret and extend published results on the impact of longdistance dispersal on the genetic structure of populations, we examine a classification of dispersal kernels based on the shape of their tails and formally demonstrate qualitative differences among them that can influence the predicted diversity of a propagule pool sampled far from two distinct sources. Results: We show that a fat-tailed kernel leads asymptotically to a diverse propagule pool containing a balanced mixing of the propagules from the two sources, whereas a thin-tailed kernel results in all propagules originating from the closest source. We further show that these results hold for biologically relevant distances under certain circumstances, and in particular if the number of propagules is large enough, as would be the case for pollen or seeds. Conclusion: To understand the impact of long-distance dispersal on the structure and dynamics of a metapopulation, it might be less important to precisely estimate an average dispersal distance than to determine if the tail of the dispersal kernel is fatter or thinner than that of an exponential function. Depending solely on this characteristic, a metapopulation will behave similarly to an island model with a diverse immigrant pool or to a stepping-stone model with migrants from closest populations. Our results further help to understand why thin-tailed dispersal kernels lead to a colonization wave of constant speed, whereas fat-tailed dispersal kernels lead to a wave of increasing speed. Our results also suggest that the diversity of the pollen cloud of a mother plant should increase with increasing isolation for fat-tailed kernels, whereas it should decrease for thintailed kernels.},

	abstract = {Mating with more than one pollen donor, or polyandry, is common in land plants. In flowering plants, polyandry occurs when the pollen from different potential sires is distributed among the fruits of a single individual, or when pollen from more than one donor is deposited on the same stigma. Because polyandry typically leads to multiple paternity among or within fruits, it can be indirectly inferred on the basis of paternity analysis using molecular markers. A review of the literature indicates that polyandry is probably ubiquitous in plants except those that habitually self-fertilize, or that disperse their pollen in pollen packages, such as polyads or pollinia. Multiple mating may increase plants' female component by alleviating pollen limitation or by promoting competition among pollen grains from different potential sires. Accordingly, a number of traits have evolved that should promote polyandry at the flower level from the female's point of view, e.g. the prolongation of stigma receptivity or increases in stigma size. However, many floral traits, such as attractiveness, the physical manipulation of pollinators and pollen-dispensing mechanisms that lead to polyandrous pollination, have probably evolved in response to selection to promote male siring success in general, so that polyandry might often best be seen as a by-product of selection to enhance outcross siring success. In this sense, polyandry in plants is similar to geitonogamy (selfing caused by pollen transfer among flowers of the same plant), because both polyandry and geitonogamy probably result from selection to promote outcross siring success, although geitonogamy is almost always deleterious while polyandry in plants will seldom be so.},

The range of B. terrestris now encompasses all of Tasmania’s major vegetation types, altitudes from sea level to 1260 m a.s.l., and the entire breadth of annual precipitation in the state from more than 3200 mm to less than 600 mm. Observations of workers carrying pollen, together with the presence of large numbers of bumblebees at many localities across this range indicate that colonies are frequently established in native vegetation. Evidence that colonies are often successful was obtained from repeated observations of the species during more than 1 year at particular sites. Unequivocal evidence of colonies was obtained from six National Parks, including four of the ﬁve in the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area (WHA). Indeed, the species has been present in the WHA for at least as long as it has in the city of Hobart, where it was ﬁrst recorded. In southwestern Tasmania, evidence of colonies was obtained up to 40 km from gardens, 61 km from small towns and 93 km from large towns. Hence, contrary to previous suggestions, the species is established in the most remote parts of Tasmania and is not dependent on introduced garden plants. Given their strong record of invasion, it is likely that B. terrestris will form feral populations on the mainland of Australia and in many other parts of the world if introduced. Because of their likely negative impacts on native animals and plants, and potential to enhance seed production in weeds, the spread of bumblebees should be avoided.},

Small-bodied species that start their activity later in the season and are not solitary preferred the city centre. However, bee species diversity and richness remained stable across the urban gradient indicating some advantages of being a city dwelling bee.

	abstract = {In animal-pollinated plants, both the spatial distribution of ﬂowering individuals and the number of ﬂowers that an individual displays affect pollen deposition rates and female reproductive success. Heterostylous species are likely to be particularly sensitive to the contingencies of spatial distribution, as they are reproductively subdivided into distinct mating groups, which usually exhibit self- and intra-morph incompatibility and differ in ﬂoral morphology. In this paper, we explore the joint effects of both spatial distribution of potential mates and ﬂoral display size on morph-speciﬁc pollen deposition rates and seed set patterns in two natural populations of Pulmonaria ofﬁcinalis, a distylous species with a weak self-incompatibility system. Both total stigmatic pollen load and the proportion of legitimate pollen decreased with increasing spatial isolation. Legitimate (intermorph) pollen transfer was, however, asymmetric and decreased more rapidly with decreasing proximity to a compatible legitimate mating partner in the S-morph than in the L-morph. Total stigmatic pollen loads per ﬂower increased with increasing ﬂoral display size, indicating that large plants are disproportionately more visited than smaller individuals. However, because legitimate pollen deposition decreased with increasing ﬂoral display size, these results also suggest that larger numbers of ﬂowers increase the degree of geitonogamous pollination. In both the L- and S-morph, seed set signiﬁcantly decreased with increasing isolation from a legitimate mating partner, but in the L-morph seed set was less dependent on the spatial distribution of the S-morph. In addition, seed set signiﬁcantly increased with ﬂoral display size in the L-morph, but not in the S-morph. These ﬁndings indicate that the spatial distribution of potential mates and variation in ﬂoral display size may cause morph-speciﬁc differences in pollen deposition rates and female reproductive success.},

	abstract = {There has been a proliferation of studies, in a variety of taxa, that have detected sex-linked or cytoplasmic genes that enhance their own transmission via sex-ratio distortion. One of the most important parameters influencing the dynamics of these elements is the magnitude of their transmission advantage. In many systems, the mechanism of sex-ratio distortion is to abort X- or Y-bearing gametes. With this mechanism, the transmission advantage associated with sex-ratio distortion is diminished when the production of male gametes limits offspring production or when competition among the gametes of different males is intense. In this study, we analyzed the outcome of pollen competition between males that produced different sex ratios in the dioecious plant, Silene alba, and estimated how the sex-ratio bias influenced the transmission properties of the sex chromosomes. We varied the intensity of pollen competition by controlling the quantity of pollen used in crosses and used a combination of single-male pollinations and pollen mixtures to evaluate the effects of multiple paternity. Paternity in pollen mixtures was estimated using allozymes. Sex-ratio bias was directly influenced by the quantity of pollen, but the magnitude of this effect was small. The relative performance of pollen from different males varied substantially, especially when there was multiple paternity. Specifically, males with biased sex ratios sired far fewer offspring of either sex in pollen mixtures. In crosses involving single males, however, these "sex-ratio" males produced the same number of offspring as other males, so the female bias caused a significant transmission advantage for X-linked genes. X-linked genes could enhance their transmission via sex-ratio distortion in Silene populations, but the magnitude of this transmission advantage will depend on the ecological circumstances that influence the opportunity for multiple paternity.},

	abstract = {Determining the mechanisms governing sex-ratio variation in dioecious organisms represents a central problem in evolutionary biology. It has been proposed that in plants with sex chromosomes competition between pollen tubes of female- versus male-determining microgametophytes (certation) causes female-biased primary sex ratios. Experimental support for this hypothesis is limited and recent workers have cast doubt on whether pollen-tube competition can modify sex ratios in dioecious plants. Here we investigate the inﬂuence of variation in pollination intensity on sex ratios in Rumex nivalis, a wind-pollinated alpine herb with strongly female-biased sex ratios. In a garden experiment, we experimentally manipulated pollination intensity using three concentric rings of female recipient plants at different distances from a central group of male pollen donors. This design enabled us to test the hypothesis that increasing pollen load size, by intensifying gametophyte competition, promotes female-biased sex ratios in R. nivalis. We detected a signiﬁcant decline in pollen load at successive distance classes with concomitant reductions in seed set. Sex ratios of progeny were always female biased, but plants at the closest distance to male donors exhibited signiﬁcantly greater female bias than more distant plants. The amount of female bias was positively correlated with the seed set of inﬂorescences. Hand pollination of stigmas resulted in ϳ100-fold higher stigmatic pollen loads than wind-pollinated stigmas and produced exceptionally female-biased progenies (female frequency ϭ 0.96). Our results are the ﬁrst to demonstrate a functional relation between stigmatic pollen capture, seed set, and sex ratio and suggest that certation can contribute towards female-biased sex ratios in dioecious plants.},

	abstract = {The Allee effect is a theoretical model predicting low growth rates and the possible extinction of small populations. Historically, studies of the Allee effect have focused on demography. As a result, underlying processes other than the direct effect of population density on fitness components are not generally taken into account. There has been heated debate about the potential of genetic processes to drive small populations to extinction, but recent studies have shown that such processes clearly impact small populations over short time scales, and some may generate Allee effects. However, as opposed to the ecological Allee effect, which is underpinned by cooperative interactions between individuals, genetically driven Allee effects require a change in genetic structure to link the decline in population size with a decrease in fitness components. We therefore define the genetic Allee effect as a two-s­ tep process whereby a decrease in population size leads to a change in population genetic structure and, in turn, to a decrease in individual fitness. We describe potential underlying mechanisms and review the evidence for this original type of component Allee effect, using published examples from both plants and animals. The possibility of considering demogenetic feedback in light of genetic Allee effects clarifies the analysis and interpretation of demographic and genetic processes, and the interplay between them, in small populations.},

We tested for signiﬁcant effects of population size on these characteristics, for relationships between stigma pollen loads and fruit and seed set, and for signiﬁcant variation between years in reproductive characteristics. In 1994 stigma pollen loads were inversely related to population size and were signiﬁcantly lower than in 1993. The lower stigma pollen loads in 1994 were associated with adverse weather conditions (high rainfall), which are known to affect pollinator activity and may have led to competition among plants for pollinators in large populations. However, population size was not correlated with percentage of fruit set or percentage of seed set in either year. The lack of fruit and seed set differences between large and small populations, particularly in 1994, likely resulted from the small amount of pollen needed to trigger fruit and seed production. Our results indicate that for some self-compatible species that similarly require small pollen loads, the effects of population size on reproduction are minimal, even if differences in pollen-movement exist between large and small populations.},

The foraging behaviour of insect pollinators is flexible and complex, because efficient collection of nectar or pollen is no simple matter. Each flower provides a variable but generally small reward that is often hidden, flowers are patchily distributed in time and space, and are erratically depleted of rewards by other foragers. Insects that specialise in visiting flowers have evolved an array of foraging strategies that act to improve their efficiency, which in turn determine the reproductive success of the plants that they visit. This review attempts a synthesis of the recent literature on selectivity in pollinator foraging behaviour, in terms of the species, patch and individual flowers that they choose to visit.},

	abstract = {Pollinator and/or mate scarcity affects pollen transfer, with important ecological and evolutionary consequences for plant reproduction. However, the way in which the pollen loads transported by pollinators and deposited on stigmas are affected by pollination context has been little studied. We investigated the impacts of plant mate and visiting insect availabilities on pollen transport and receipt in a mass-ﬂowering and facultative autogamous shrub (Rhododendron ferrugineum). First, we recorded insect visits to R. ferrugineum in plant patches of diverse densities and sizes. Second, we analyzed the pollen loads transported by R. ferrugineum pollinators and deposited on stigmas of emasculated and intact ﬂowers, in the same patches. Overall, pollinators (bumblebees) transported much larger pollen loads than the ones found on stigmas, and the pollen deposited on stigmas included a high proportion of conspeciﬁc pollen. However, comparing pollen loads of emasculated and intact ﬂowers indicated that pollinators contributed only half the conspeciﬁc pollen present on the stigma. At low plant density, we found the highest visitation rate and the lowest proportion of conspeciﬁc pollen transported and deposited by pollinators. By contrast, at higher plant density and lower visitation rate, pollinators deposited larger proportion of conspeciﬁc pollen, although still far from sufﬁcient to ensure that all the ovules were fertilized. Finally, self-pollen completely buffered the detrimental effects on pollination of patch fragmentation and pollinator failure. Our results indicate that pollen loads from pollinators and emasculated ﬂowers should be quantiﬁed for an accurate understanding of the relative impacts of pollinator and mate limitation on pollen transfer in facultative autogamous species.},

The causes can be myriad, and vary from lack of nesting sites for key insect pollinators, to a decline in pollinator visits when plant population sizes are reduced by fragmentation. One important and well-documented consequence of disruption in pollination systems is reduced seed production in plant populations in fragments as a result of pollen-limitation. When reduced seed production, in turn, has a negative effect on seedling recruitment, populations may enter a spiral towards extinction. Some pollination systems, on the other hand, are surprisingly resilient to anthropogenic changes, and pollen ﬂow between trees in fragments separated by several kilometres has been reported recently. Understanding how reproductive attributes of plants, such as breeding systems and speciﬁcity of pollination systems, affect the outcome of habitat fragmentation remains a key challenge.},

Many previously published SDI's do not meet any of these criteria, and none meet more than three. We present an alternative SDI based on the mean size of the larger sex divided by the mean size of the smaller sex with the result arbitrarily defined as positive (minus one) when females are larger and negative (plus one) in the converse case.

	abstract = {The fact that selﬁng increases seed set (reproductive assurance) has often been put forward as an important selective force for the evolution of selﬁng. However, the role of reproductive assurance in hermaphroditic populations is far from being clear because of a lack of theoretical work. Here, I propose a theoretical model that analyzes selffertilization in the presence of reproductive assurance. Because reproductive assurance directly inﬂuences the per capita growth rate, I developed an explicit demographic model for partial selfers in the presence of reproductive assurance, speciﬁcally when outcrossing is limited by the possibility of pollen transfer (Allee effect). Mating system parameters are derived as a function of the underlying demographical parameters. The functional link between population demography and mating system parameters (reproductive assurance, selﬁng rate) can be characterized. The demographic model permits the analysis of the evolution of self-fertilization in stable populations when reproductive assurance occurs. The model reveals some counterintuitive results such as the fact that increasing the fraction of selfed ovules can, in certain circumstances, increase the fraction of outcrossed ovules. Moreover, I demonstrate that reproductive assurance per se cannot account for the evolution of stable mixed selﬁng rates. Also, the model reveals that the extinction of outcrossing populations depends on small changes in population density (ecological perturbations), while the transition from outcrossing to selﬁng can, in certain cases, lead the population to extinction (evolutionary suicide). More generally, this paper highlights the fact that self-fertilization affects both the dynamics of individuals and the dynamics of selﬁng genes in hermaphroditic populations.},

For comparing two coefﬁcients, we consider the signed-likelihood ratio test (SLRT) and propose a modiﬁed version of the SLRT, and a generalized test. Monte Carlo studies on the type I error rates of the tests indicate that the modiﬁed SLRT and the generalized test work satisfactorily even for very small samples, and they are comparable in terms of power. Generalized conﬁdence intervals for the ratio of (or difference between) two coefﬁcients of variation are also developed. A modiﬁed LRT for testing the equality of several coefﬁcients of variation is also proposed and compared with an asymptotic test and a simulation-based small sample test. The proposed modiﬁed LRTs seem to be very satisfactory even for samples of size three. The methods are illustrated using two examples.},

	abstract = {For sexual selection to be important in plants, it must occur at pollen load sizes typical of ﬁeld populations. However, studies of the impact of pollen load size on pollen competition have given mixed results, perhaps because so few of these studies directly examined the outcome of mating when pollen load size was varied. We asked whether seed paternity after mixed pollination of wild radish was affected by pollen load sizes ranging from 22 to 220 pollen grains per stigma. We examined the seed siring abilities of 12 pollen donors across 11 maternal plants. Seed paternity was statistically indistinguishable across the pollen load sizes even though, overall, the pollen donors sired different numbers of seeds. This lack of effect of pollen load size on seed paternity may have occurred because fruit abortion and early abortion or failure of fertilization of seeds increased as load size decreased. Thus, failures of fruits and seeds sired by poorer pollen donors may keep seed paternity constant across pollen load sizes.},

	abstract = {It is frequently observed that males of dioecious plant species ﬂower earlier in the season than females, although the generality of this pattern has not been quantiﬁed. One hypothesis for earlier male ﬂowering is that females require more time for resource acquisition before reproduction; another is that selection for access to unfertilized ovules favors early-ﬂowering males. Here I show that protandry is indeed the usual pattern in dioecious plants—males typically initiate ﬂowering before females—and I propose a new hypothesis to explain this pattern. In many natural plant populations, individuals that begin ﬂowering early are larger and—in the case of females or hermaphrodites—therefore more fecund. When this population-level seasonal decline in size is included in simulations of ﬂowering time evolution in a dioecious plant, males evolve earlier ﬂowering onset than females. Correlations between size (or condition) and reproductive phenology are widespread and likely contribute to the prevalence of protandry in both plants and animals, but their importance seems to have been overlooked by botanists. I suggest that sexual selection (speciﬁcally, male-male competition for access to high-quality ovules) may play a more important role in the evolution of ﬂowering phenology than has previously been recognized.},

Although more parsimonious hypotheses exist for the evolution of ecological sexual dimorphisms, there are some underappreciated reasons to expect that competition may often play some role in the evolution of sexual dimorphism. Here, we build on past work to outline a set of sufﬁcient criteria to demonstrate a role for resource competition in the evolution of sexual dimorphism, the most critical of which is that resource competition can be directly linked to sexual divergence along the axis of ecologically relevant dimorphism. We then compare the geometry of ﬁtness surfaces across experimental manipulations of density and sex ratio in a semiaquatic salamander (Notophthalmus viridescens). We ﬁnd consistent disruptive selection on multivariate sexual dimorphism in feeding morphology, which increases in strength with density. Fitness and the strength of divergent selection are negative-frequency dependent in the manner expected under competition-driven divergence between the sexes. Our results constitute direct evidence of resource competition as a driver of sexually antagonist selection and consequently the evolution of sexual dimorphism, providing an illustration of how cause and effect can be separated in studies of sexual divergence in morphology and ecology. We suggest that resource competition may often contribute to sexual divergence jointly with other sources of sex-biased selection, especially when ecological opportunity is sex speciﬁc.},

Using two spatially explicit mating models that analyse the genotypes of seeds and seedlings, we investigated the variation of male and female fecundities within and among three European beech (Fagus sylvatica) stands situated along an altitudinal gradient. Female and male individual fecundity distributions were both skewed in this monoecious species, and we found a higher variance in female as compared to male fecundities. Both female and male fecundities increased with tree size and decreased with density and competition in the neighbourhood, the details of these effects suggesting sex‐specific strategies to deal with the impact of limited resource on fecundity. The studied populations were functionally male‐biased. Among‐individual variations in functional gender were not driven by tree size but by density and competition in the neighbourhood. Femaleness decreased under limited resource availability, an expected consequence of the higher cost of female reproduction. Considering the variation of gene flow and genetic drift across elevation, our results suggest that the adaptive potential could be enhanced by low genetic drift at low elevation, and by high pollen‐mediated gene flow at high elevation. Finally, this study predicts a more efficient response to selection for traits related to male vs. female fitness, for a given selection intensity.},

This makes possible the reorganization of broodstock in groups with low relatedness, as well as the identification of families in selection programs to avoid the harmful effects of inbreeding and to maintain the highest diversity as possible across generations. The choice of the appropriate genetic marker and the statistical methodology is essential to get the best solution for the questions considered. Depending on the availability of previous information on the genealogy, paternity or kinship analysis will be applied. The simplest approach to paternity inference, involves parent identification through the exclusion of the remaining candidates. However, this can lead to more than one solution, solvable after application of maximum likelihood procedures. The ability to identify the parents of each offspring depends on the sampling scenario (number of candidate parents and the fraction sampled), on the potential of the markers used (polymorphism, genotyping errors), and on the conformance to theoretical assumptions of the statistical models applied. A large number of paternity programs are freely available. They display usually complementary performances, and there is not the best software for all situations.},

Subsequent treatments of sexual selection have emphasized the importance of intra- and intersexual interactions as sources of sexual selection. However, many traits that are important determinants of mating success influence mating success without necessarily affecting the outcome of intra- and intersexual interactions. Here, I argue that traits can be subject to sexual selection even if they do not affect the outcome of intra- and intersexual interactions. I distinguish two types of sexual selection, interaction-independent and interaction-dependent selection, based on whether variance in mating success is the result of trait-dependent outcomes of interactions between conspecifics. I then use this distinction to construct a framework for classifying types of sexual selection that unifies and expands previously proposed frameworks. Finally, I outline several implications that the concept of interaction-independent sexual selection has for the general theory of sexual selection.},

	abstract = {Protandry refers to the earlier appearance of males before females at sites of reproduction. Sexual selection has been hypothesized to give rise to sex differences in beneﬁts and costs of early arrival, thereby selecting for earlier appearance by the sex subject to more intense sexual selection. If sexual selection is more intense, there is a greater premium on early arrival among individuals of the chosen sex because of direct selection for earlier arrival. This hypothesis leads to the prediction that changes in the costs and beneﬁts of early arrival related to changes in environmental conditions should particularly affect the sex that arrives ﬁrst and hence the degree of protandry. I tested this hypothesis using the Barn Swallow Hirundo rustica. During 1971–2003, the degree of protandry increased signiﬁcantly in a Danish population because males advanced arrival date while females did not. This earlier arrival by males compared with females was correlated with a signiﬁcant increase by over 1.2 standard deviations in the length of the outermost tail feathers of males, a secondary sexual character, suggesting direct selection on both protandry and the secondary sexual character. Environmental conditions during spring migration in Northern Africa, as reﬂected by the normalized difference vegetation index, have deteriorated since 1984, resulting in increased mortality among males during spring migration, but not among females, and this deterioration of climatic conditions was positively correlated with an increasing degree of protandry. Likewise, an increase in April temperatures at the breeding grounds during recent decades is positively correlated with increased protandry, apparently because males can arrive earlier without increasing the ﬁtness cost of early arrival.

	abstract = {In many flowering plants individual fruits contain a mixture of half- and full- siblings, reflecting pollination by several fathers. To better understand the mechanisms generating multiple paternity within fruits we present a theoretical framework linking pollen carryover with patterns of pollinator movement. This ‘sire profile’ model predicts that species with more extensive pollen carryover will have a greater number of mates. It also predicts that flowers on large displays, which are often probed consecutively during a single pollinator visitation sequence, will have a lower effective number of mates. We compared these predictions with observed values for bumble bee-pollinated Mimulus ringens, which has restricted carryover, and hummingbird-pollinated Ipomopsis aggregata, which has extensive carryover. The model correctly predicted that the effective number of mates is much higher in the species with more extensive carryover. This work extends our knowledge of plant mating systems by highlighting mechanisms influencing the genetic composition of sibships.},

I compared male and female reproductive success of two congeners at natural densities in the sea. The eggs of the species occurring at higher densities, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, require higher sperm concentrations for fertilization but are more resistant to polyspermy compared to S. franciscanus. Both species show high variance in male fertilization success at all densities and high variance in female success at low densities, but they differ in female variance at high densities, where only S. franciscanus shows high female variance. The intensity of sexual selection based on Bateman gradients is high in males of both species, variable in S. franciscanus females, and low in S. purpuratus females. Strongylocentrotus franciscanus females experience sexual selection at low densities and sexual conﬂict at high densities. Strongylocentrotus purpuratus may rarely experience sperm limitation and may have evolved to ameliorate sexual conﬂict. This reduces the variance in female fertilization, providing females with more control over fertilization. Sperm availability inﬂuences sexual selection directly by determining sperm–egg encounter probabilities and indirectly through selection on gamete traits that alter reproductive variances.},

Four experimental groups were set up (in a 2 · 2 factorial design) with small or large group size and with small or large enclosures to control for potential confounding effects of density. We measured the proportion of female and male investment in focal individuals. Results revealed that individuals regulated their reproductive output so that when reproductive competitors were present, the number of female gametes was strongly reduced and the male function increased. In contrast, under monogamy, individuals in small groups produced lower numbers of sperm but had a higher egg output than worms in large groups. Density did not affect sex allocation in our experiment.

	abstract = {Evolutionary biologists generally invoke male competition and female choice as mechanisms driving sexual selection. However, in broadcast-spawning organisms sperm may be limiting and females may compete, in the Darwinian sense, for increased mating success. In this study, I investigate how species differences in egg and sperm traits result in different patterns of fertilization among three closely related sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus, S. franciscanus, and S. droebachiensis). Field studies demonstrate that all three species achieve similar percentages of eggs fertilized when eggs and sperm are released simultaneously. However, when sperm must disperse before encountering eggs, differences arise among species such that those with the smaller eggs and faster but shorter-lived sperm achieve relatively fewer fertilizations than do species with larger eggs and slower but longer-lived sperm. A field hybridization experiment, field estimates of sperm dispersal, correlations of egg size to field rates of fertilization, laboratory studies of fertilization kinetics, and a simulation model all suggest that it is attributes of the egg (probably egg size) that are responsible for the differences. These patterns of fertilization match the species' patterns of dispersion; species that do well only when sperm and eggs are released in close proximity are more aggregated, species that do relatively well when sperm and eggs are released farther apart are more dispersed. These results are consistent with the notion that eggs of different species are adapted to maximize reproductive success under different degrees of sperm limitation and suggest that male competition and female choice may not be an appropriate dichotomy in broadcast-spawning organisms.},

This difference is thought to be a result of the more frequent spermegg collisions experienced by larger targets. Here we report how two components of egg target size, the egg cell and jelly coat, contributed to fertilization success in a selection experiment. We used a cross-sectional analysis of correlated characters to estimate the selection gradients on egg and jelly-coat size in ﬁve replicate male pairs of the sand dollar Dendraster excentricus. Results indicated that eggs with larger cells and jelly coats were preferentially fertilized under sperm limitation in the laboratory. The selection gradients were an average of 922\% steeper for egg than for jellycoat size. The standardized selection gradients for egg and jelly-coat size were similar. Our results suggest that fertilization selection can act on both egg-cell and jelly-coat size but that an increase in egg-cell volume is much more likely to increase fertilization success than an equal change in jelly-coat volume. The strengths of the selection gradients were inversely related to the correlation of egg traits across replicate egg clutches. This result suggests the importance of replication in studies of selection of correlated characters.},

Here, we demonstrate the problematic nature of these predictions. The OSR and Is only accurately predict sexual selection under a limited set of circumstances, and more speciﬁcally, only when mate monopolization is extremely strong. If mate monopolization is not strong, using OSR or Is as proxies or measures of sexual selection is expected to produce spurious results that lead to the false conclusion that sexual selection is strong when it is actually weak.

	abstract = {Premise of the Research: The wide diversity of floral traits seen among plants is shaped by neutral and selective evolutionary processes. In outcrossing species, sexual selection from competing pollen donors is expected to be important for shaping mating system-related traits but empirical evidence is scarce. In a previous evaluation of experimental evolution lines crossed with either one or two pollen donors (monogamous, M, or polyandrous, P, lines) at early floral stages in mixed-mating Collinsia heterophylla (Plantaginaceae), P showed enhanced pollen competitive ability and reduced maternal seed set compared to M, in accordance with sexually antagonistic evolution of pollen. Here, we asked whether the presence of sexual selection during pollen competition affect mating system-related floral traits in the same lines. Methodology: We compared flowering start, timing of anther-stigma contact (as an indication of timing of self-pollination), timing of stigma receptivity and first seed set between M and P, and with a source line, S (starting material). The former three traits are later in outcrossers than in selfers of Collinsia. The latter trait was expected to be earlier in P than in M because of sexual selection for early seed siring of pollen. Pivotal Results: Artificial polyandry for four generations resulted in later flowering start and later anther-stigma contact in P compared to M, and the latter trait was intermediate in S. Thus, P appeared more 'outcrossing' than M. Stigma receptivity did not differ between lines. First seed set was earlier in P than in M, as expected from sexual selection. Conclusions: Our results from C. heterophylla experimental evolution lines suggest that a component of sexual selection during outcross pollination could enhance the patterns of floral divergence commonly found between outcrossers and selfers.},

	abstract = {In gynodioecious plant species with nuclear-cytoplasmic sex determination, females and hermaphrodites plants can coexist whenever female have higher seed ﬁtness than hermaphrodites. Although the effect of self fertilization on seed ﬁtness in hermaphrodites has been considered theoretically, this effect is far from intuitive, because it can either increase the relative seed ﬁtness of the females (if it leads hermaphrodites to produce inbred, low quality offspring) or decrease it (if it provides reproductive assurance to hermaphrodites). Hence, empirical investigation is needed to document whether relative seed ﬁtness varies with whether pollen is or is not limiting to seed production. In the current study, we measured fruit set and seed production in both females and hermaphrodites and the selﬁng rate in hermaphrodites in two experimental patches that differed in sex ratios in the gynodioecious plant Silene nutans. We found an impact of plant gender, patch, and their interaction, with females suffering from stronger pollen limitation when locally frequent. In the most pollen-limited situation, the selﬁng rate of hermaphrodites increased and provided hermaphrodites with a type of reproductive assurance that is not available to females. By integrating both the beneﬁcial (reproductive assurance) and costly effects (through inbreeding depression) of self-pollination, we showed that whether females did or did not exhibit higher seed ﬁtness depended on the degree of pollen limitation on seed production.},

	abstract = {Summary The diurnal hawkmoth Macroglossum stellatarum is known to feed from a variety of ﬂower species of almost all colours, forms and sizes. A newly eclosed imago, however, has to ﬁnd its ﬁrst ﬂower by means of an innate ﬂower template. This study investigates which visual ﬂower features are represented in this template and their relative importance. Newly eclosed imagines were tested for their innate preferences, using artiﬁcial ﬂowers made out of coloured paper or projected onto a screen through interference ﬁlters. The moths were found to have a strong preference for 440 nm and a weaker preference for 540 nm. The attractiveness of a colour increases with light intensity. The background colour, as well as the spectral composition of the ambient illumination, inﬂuences the choice behaviour. Blue paper disks against a yellowish background are chosen much more often than the same disks against a bluish background. Similarly, under ultraviolet-rich illumination, the preference for 540 nm is much more pronounced than under yellowish illumination. Disks of approximately 32 mm in diameter are preferred to smaller and larger ones, and a sectored pattern is more attractive than a ring pattern. Pattern preferences are less pronounced with coloured than with black-and-white patterns. Tests using combinations of two parameters reveal that size is more important than colour and that colour is more important than pattern.},

Heritabilities and variance components were estimated for nectar and morphological traits of Nicotiana alata, using a partial diallel design. The main experiment was conducted in a Missouri experimental garden using a randomized block design with three plant density treatments, whereas a smaller experiment was conducted near native Brazil habitat to compare the environmental variance in traits between Missouri and Brazil. Signiﬁcant heritability was detected for nectar volume and energy content, and for corolla tube length. Phenotypic correlations were signiﬁcant between all traits investigated, whereas signiﬁcant genetic correlations were only found between nectar volume and energy and between corolla limb width and mouth diameter. There were no signiﬁcant family-by-density interactions detected in the Missouri ﬁeld environment. All traits differed signiﬁcantly between Missouri and Brazil environments, but signiﬁcant genetic by environment (G × E) interactions between Missouri and Brazil were detected for only one trait. This study shows that nectar traits can be heritable despite considerable environmental variation.},

However, do all dioecious plants show sex-related differences in stress tolerance? To what extent can the environmental context and modularity mask sex-related differences in stress tolerance? Finally, to what extent can physiological measurements help us understand secondary sexual dimorphism? This opinion paper aims to answer these three basic questions with special emphasis on developments in research in this area over the last decade. Compelling evidence indicates that dimorphic species do not always show differences in stress tolerance between sexes; and when sex-related differences do occur, they seem to be highly species-specific, with greater stress tolerance in females than males in some species, and the opposite in others. The causes of such sex-related species-specific differences are still poorly understood, and more physiological studies and diversity of plant species that allow comparative analyses are needed. Furthermore, studies performed thus far demonstrate that the expression of dioecy can lead to sex-related differences in physiological traits—from leaf gas exchange to gene expression—but the biological significance of modularity and sectoriality governing such differences has been poorly investigated. Future studies that consider the importance of modularity and sectoriality are essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying stress adaptation in male and female plants growing in their natural habitat.},

The most important technological breakthrough was the introduction of microsatellite markers to molecular ecology, an advance that was accompanied by a proliferation and reﬁnement of statistical techniques for the analysis of parentage data. Over the last several years, we have seen steady progress in a number of areas related to parentage analysis, and the prospects for successful studies continue to improve. Here, we provide an updated guide for scientists interested in embarking on parentage analysis in natural or artiﬁcial populations of organisms, with a particular focus on computer software packages that implement various methods of analysis. Our survey of the literature shows that there are a few established methods that perform extremely well in the analysis of most types of parentage studies. However, particular experimental designs or study systems can beneﬁt from some of the less well-known computer packages available. Overall, we ﬁnd that parentage analysis is feasible and satisfying in most systems, and we try to provide a simple roadmap to help other scientists navigate the confusing topography of statistical techniques.},

	abstract = {The fundamental equation in evolutionary quantitative genetics, the Lande equation, describes the response to directional selection as a product of the additive genetic variance and the selection gradient of trait value on relative ﬁtness. Comparisons of both genetic variances and selection gradients across traits or populations require standardization, as both are scale dependent. The Lande equation can be standardized in two ways. Standardizing by the variance of the selected trait yields the response in units of standard deviation as the product of the heritability and the variance-standardized selection gradient. This standardization conﬂates selection and variation because the phenotypic variance is a function of the genetic variance. Alternatively, one can standardize the Lande equation using the trait mean, yielding the proportional response to selection as the product of the squared coefﬁcient of additive genetic variance and the mean-standardized selection gradient. Mean-standardized selection gradients are particularly useful for summarizing the strength of selection because the mean-standardized gradient for ﬁtness itself is one, a convenient benchmark for strong selection. We review published estimates of directional selection in natural populations using mean-standardized selection gradients. Only 38 published studies provided all the necessary information for calculation of mean-standardized gradients. The median absolute value of multivariate mean-standardized gradients shows that selection is on average 54\% as strong as selection on ﬁtness. Correcting for the upward bias introduced by taking absolute values lowers the median to 31\%, still very strong selection. Such large estimates clearly cannot be representative of selection on all traits. Some possible sources of overestimation of the strength of selection include confounding environmental and genotypic effects on ﬁtness, the use of ﬁtness components as proxies for ﬁtness, and biases in publication or choice of traits to study.},

We trained bumblebees of two colonies to forage in a community of deceptive and rewarding artiﬁcial inﬂorescences whose ﬂower colours were either similar or dissimilar. We then modiﬁed the community composition by turning the rewarding inﬂorescences into unrewarding and adding rewarding inﬂorescences of a novel ﬂower colour. In the short term, bees trained to similar rather than dissimilar inﬂorescences experienced higher costs of foraging (decreased foraging speed and accuracy) in the novel community. The colonies differed in their speed-accuracy tradeoff.

The results suggest that the small-scale structuring occurs during population expansion, soon after island colonization, and that the observed patterns of genetic differentiation can be attributed to the population being substructured into family groups. This family structure results from kin-structured dispersal processes (colonization and migration) as the population expands over the island. As plant densities increase over time, either spatial fusion or temporal fusion of patches reduce the among patch variation. These processes, however, do not completely eradicate the genetic differentiation established by the kin-structured dispersal processes. We discuss some implications of kin structuring for evolution through either kin or interdemic selection.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection is generally predicted to act more strongly on males than on females. The Darwin-Bateman paradigm predicts that this should also hold for hermaphrodites. However, measuring this strength of selection is less straightforward when both sexual functions are performed throughout the organism’s lifetime. Besides, quantifications of sexual selection are usually done during a short time window, while many animals store sperm and are long-lived. To explore whether the chosen time frame affects estimated measures of sexual selection, we recorded mating success and reproductive success over time, using a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Our results show that male sexual selection gradients are consistently positive. However, an individual’s female mating success seems to negatively affect its own male reproductive success, an effect that only becomes visible several weeks into the experiment, highlighting that the time frame is crucial for the quantification and interpretation of sexual selection measures, an insight that applies to any iteroparous mating system. , Many factors affect an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. These factors are often called “selection pressures” and include the availability of food and shelter, conditions in the environment such as temperature, and the presence of diseases and predators. Males and females experience different selection pressures so they often evolve to look different – consider, for example, the male deer’s antlers and the peacock’s colourful tail feathers. Such traits arise from a phenomenon called sexual selection, the selection pressures that act on an organism’s ability to obtain a mate. Measuring sexual selection is not only of interest to scientists looking to understand how evolutionary processes work; it also has wider applications, including in wildlife conservation. For instance, knowing which cues are important for successful reproduction could help efforts to breed endangered animals in captivity and stop them from going extinct. Scientists study sexual selection in a species by measuring how successful males and females are at mating and reproducing. Past studies have found that a female’s reproductive success mainly depends on there being enough resources available for her to produce eggs, while a male’s success depends on him getting access to these eggs. However, most research into sexual selection has been on species with separate sexes. It is more difficult to measure sexual selection in species – like snails and slugs – where each individual is male and female at the same time. As such, it is not clear if reproductive success in these species, which are known as simultaneous hermaphrodites, depends on the same factors as those species with separate sexes. To address this, Hoffer et al. measured sexual selection in the great pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis, a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Most studies estimate sexual selection based on measurements taken over several days. Instead, Hoffer et al. observed the great pond snail over a period of eight weeks, which is about a quarter of its reproductive life. The experiments showed that mating multiple times, especially with multiple partners, overall improves the development of the snail’s offspring. The male part of the great pond snail gains the most reproductive success from repeated mating, whereas the female part may in fact be negatively affected. These negative effects were only seen several weeks into the experiment, and so they show that sexual selection pressures change over time. Future research is needed to determine what causes the negative effects on the female part of the great pond snail. Overall, these findings stress the need for careful consideration of the time frame over which future measurements of sexual selection take place, not just in hermaphrodites, but in all species.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection is a cornerstone of evolutionary theory, but measuring it has proved surprisingly difficult and controversial. Various proxy measures—e.g., the Bateman gradient and the opportunity for sexual selection—are widely used in empirical studies. However, we do not know how reliably these measures predict the strength of sexual selection across natural systems, and most perform poorly in theoretical worst-case scenarios. Here we provide a rigorous comparison of eight commonly used indexes of sexual selection. We simulated 500 biologically plausible mating systems, based on the templates of five well-studied species that cover a diverse range of reproductive life histories. We compared putative indexes to the actual strength of premating sexual selection, measured as the strength of selection on a simulated “mating trait.” This method sidesteps a key weakness of empirical studies, which lack an appropriate yardstick against which proxy measures can be assessed. Our model predicts that, far from being useless, the best proxy measures reliably track the strength of sexual selection across biologically realistic scenarios. The maximum intensity of precopulatory sexual selection s ′ max (the Jones index) outperformed all other indexes and was highly correlated with the strength of sexual selection. In contrast, the Bateman gradient and the opportunity for sexual selection were poor predictors of sexual selection, despite their continuing popularity.},

In this study, we experimentally test local adaptation in a generalist plant-pollinator geographic mosaic, by means of a transplant experiment in which plants coming from two evolutionary hotspots and two coldspots were offered to pollinators at the same four localities. Plants produced in the hotspots attracted more pollinators in all populations, whereas coldspot plants attracted fewer pollinators in all populations. Differences in adaptation were not related to genetic similarity between populations, suggesting that it was mainly due to spatial variation in previous selective regimes.

Here, I examine experimentally the effects of pollinator visitation on pollen removal, pollen dispersal success, paternity, and gene flow. Bumble bee pollinators visited donor individuals homozygous for marker alleles at an isozyme (GOT-2) encoding locus and then were presented with arrays of recipient plants lacking the marker alleles. Four aspects of male fitness were estimated for each donor: the number of pollen grains dispersed to flowers of the first recipient visited, the number of offspring sired on that recipient, the proportion of offspring sired in the full array, and the proportion of mates in the array bearing seeds of the donor. Pollen removal was strongly influenced by the number of bee visits to donor flowers. The amount of pollen removed in tum significantly affected the number of pollen grains reaching flowers of the first recipient. However, because seed production decelerates with stigma pollen load, the relationship between pollen export and paternal success at this proximate scale showed diminishing returns. The probability of reaching mates within the array also increased with pollen export. These findings show that floral characters enhancing pollinator visitation rate in P. viscosum have positive effects on paternity and gene flow.},

Consequently, sperm encounter the considerable challenges of locating and fertilizing eggs from conspeciﬁc females. To overcome these challenges, many taxa exhibit species-speciﬁc attraction of sperm toward eggs through chemical signals released from eggs (sperm chemotaxis) and species-speciﬁc gamete recognition proteins (GRPs) that mediate compatibility of gametes at fertilization. In this prospective review, we highlight these selective forces, but also emphasize the role that sexual selection, manifested through sperm competition, cryptic female choice, and evolutionary conﬂicts of interest between the sexes (sexual conﬂict), can also play in mediating the action of egg chemoattractants and GRPs, and thus individual reproductive ﬁtness. Furthermore, we explore patterns of selection at the level of gametes (sperm phenotype, gamete plasticity, and egg traits) to identify putative traits targeted by sexual selection in these species. We conclude by emphasizing the excellent, but relatively untapped, potential of broadcast-spawning marine invertebrates as model systems to illuminate several areas of research in post-mating sexual selection.},

	abstract = {In dioecious, zoophilous plants potential pollinators have to be attracted to both sexes and switch between individuals of both sexes for pollination to occur. It often has been suggested that males and females require different numbers of visits for maximum reproductive success because male fertility is more likely limited by access to mates, whereas female fertility is rather limited by resource availability. According to sexual selection theory, males therefore should invest more in pollinator attraction (advertisement, reward) than females. However, our knowledge on the sex specific investment in floral rewards and advertisement, and its effects on pollinator behaviour is limited. Here, we use an approach that includes chemical, spectrophotometric, and behavioural studies i) to elucidate differences in floral nectar reward and advertisement (visual, olfactory cues) in dioecious sallow, Salix caprea, ii) to determine the relative importance of visual and olfactory floral cues in attracting honey bee pollinators, and iii) to test for differential attractiveness of female and male inflorescence cues to honey bees. Nectar amount and sugar concentration are comparable, but sugar composition varies between the sexes. Olfactory sallow cues are more attractive to honey bees than visual cues; however, a combination of both cues elicits the strongest behavioural responses in bees. Male flowers are due to the yellow pollen more colourful and emit a higher amount of scent than females. Honey bees prefer the visual but not the olfactory display of males over those of females. In all, the data of our multifaceted study are consistent with the sexual selection theory and provide novel insights on how the model organism honey bee uses visual and olfactory floral cues for locating host plants.},

In particular, they do not account for the degree to which mating opportunities can be monopolized by individuals of the sex that compete for mates. We introduce a measure of mate monopolization (m) based on the magnitude of correlated paternity and evaluate its ability to track changes in the magnitude of sexual selection. Simulation models were used to compare how well m tracked changes in the selection differential (s) for a trait regulating mating success. We further evaluated the association between m and s using ten replicate mating arrays of Sagittaria latifolia in which plants with contrasting alleles at microsatellite loci competed for siring opportunities. The computer models and mating arrays both demonstrated a positive linear association between m and s, supporting the utility of m as an index of sexual selection. Commonly used measures of sexual selection are not easily applied to organisms, such as the ﬂowering plants, for which mating events are difﬁcult to observe. The measure of mate monopolization introduced here could prove to be a useful addition to studies of sexual selection in these organisms.},

	abstract = {The optimal deployment of reproductive resources by hermaphrodites to male versus female function (i.e., their sex allocation) depends directly on opportunities for mating. If hermaphrodites occur among females, selection should favor those with a male-biased allocation because increased male allocation enhances siring success when eggs are abundant [1–3]. Similarly, when hermaphrodites co-occur with males, selection should favor those that bias their allocation toward their female function. We tested these predictions by allowing hermaphrodites of the plant Mercurialis annua to evolve in either the presence or absence of males. In the presence of males, hermaphrodites did not evolve, probably because they were already strongly female biased in the base population. However, hermaphrodites mating in the absence of males evolved greater male allocation, as predicted. Our results provide the ﬁrst demonstration of an evolutionary response to the frequency of unisexuals in hermaphroditic sex allocation, and they verify the quantitative phase predicted by models for the transition between hermaphroditism and dioecy [4, 5].},

Here, we use Passiﬂora incarnata to address how ﬂoral traits that affect pollination success are selected via female function. We manipulated the ecological context by limiting pollination and adding resources to expand the phenotypic distribution and alter the intensity of sexual selection. Total sexual selection favoured lower style deﬂexion because of its impact on pollen receipt and subsequent seed number. However, total selection on style deﬂexion was not signiﬁcant, indicating additional selection on style deﬂexion through routes other than mating. Limited pollination and enhanced resources were expected to alter the distribution of pollen deposition and seed production and therefore intensify the Bateman gradient – the relationship between pollen receipt and seed production. Indeed, the Bateman gradient was strongest when pollination was limited, suggesting potential for sexual selection to inﬂuence ﬂoral trait evolution under these conditions. Overall, we found ﬂoral traits may be shaped by sexual selection through female reproductive success in this hermaphroditic plant. These results support manipulations to enhance the variance in mating as a mechanism to understand patterns of sexual selection.},

	abstract = {In dioecious plants, females typically invest more biomass in reproduction than males and consequently experience stronger life-history trade-offs. Sexual dimorphism in life history runs counter to this pattern in Silene latifolia: females acquire less carbon and invest more biomass in reproduction, but males pay a higher cost of reproduction. The species is sexually dimorphic for many traits, especially ﬂower number, with males producing many, small ﬂowers compared to females. We tested whether the cost of reproduction is higher in males because ﬂower number, which we presume to be under sexual selection in males, is genetically correlated with traits that would affect life-history trade-offs. We performed artiﬁcial selection to reduce the sexual dimorphism in ﬂower size and looked at correlated responses in ecophysiological traits. We found signiﬁcant correlated responses in total vegetative mass, leaf mass, leaf thickness, and measures of CO2 exchange. Individuals in the manyand-small-ﬂowered selection lines did not grow as large or invest as much biomass in leaves, and their leaves exhibited an up-regulated physiology that shortened leaf life span. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that genetic correlations between ﬂoral display and ecophysiological traits lead to a higher cost of reproduction for males.},

	abstract = {Females of dioecious plant species are expected to show greater trade-offs with other life history traits than males because of their high investment in reproduction. We investigated life history traits and resource allocation patterns for both males and females of the dioecious plant Silene latifolia, to document allocation both prior to and after reproductive investment. In addition, the impact of fruit production on subsequent allocation to reproduction and growth was investigated by varying the number of flowers pollinated on females. The mean date of first reproduction was the same for males and females. Earlyflowering plants of both sexes invested less in leaf biomass than plants that delayed flowering. The percentage of flowers pollinated had a significant effect on how resources were allocated, and on the amount and timing of further flower production. Sexual dimorphism was observed in resource allocation patterns after, but not prior to, investment in reproduction. Overall, pollinated females were found to have more leaf biomass and invest nearly twice as much in reproduction as males, in spite of an apparent trade-off between leaf production and reproduction within both females and males. We conclude that sexual dimorphism in life history traits that affects resource acquisition causes the resource pool that is allocated to be variable, rather than static, thereby masking the underlying tradeoffs.},

We examined staminate- and pistillate-phase flowers of protandrous Saponaria officinalis for dimorphism in floral traits and their effects on pollinator attraction and seed set. Pistillate-phase flowers have larger petals, greater mass, and are pinker in color, but due to a shape change, pistillatephase flowers have smaller corolla diameters than staminate-phase flowers. There was no difference in nectar volume or sugar content one day after anthesis, and minimal evidence for UV nectar guide patterns in staminate- and pistillate-phase flowers. When presented with choice arrays, pollinators discriminated against pistillate-phase flowers based on their pink color. Finally, in an experimental garden, in 2012 there was a negative correlation between seed set of an open-pollinated, emasculated flower and pinkness (as measured by reflectance spectrometry) of a pistillate-phase flower on the same plant in plots covered with shade cloth. In 2013, clones of genotypes chosen from the 2012 plants that produced pinker flowers had lower seed set than those from genotypes with paler flowers. Lower seed set of pink genotypes was found in openpollinated and hand-pollinated flowers, indicating the lower seed set might be due to other differences between pink and pale genotypes in addition to pollinator discrimination against pink flowers. In conclusion, staminate- and pistillate-phase flowers of S. officinalis are dimorphic in shape and color. Pollinators discriminate among flowers based on these differences, and individuals whose pistillate-phase flowers are most different in color from their staminate-phase flowers make fewer seeds. We suggest morphological studies of the two sex phases in dichogamous, hermaphroditic species can contribute to understanding the evolution of sexual dimorphism in plants without the confounding effects of genetic differences between separate male and female individuals.},

Twentieth Century changes in range and frequency of these forage plants were assessed using data from the New Atlas of the British and Irish Flora (1930–1969 to 1987–1999) and the Countryside Surveys of Britain (1978–1998). Forage plants declined in both large-scale range and local-scale frequency between the two survey periods. These changes were of greater magnitude than changes in other native plant species, reﬂecting serious reductions in quality of foraging habitats for bees as well as a general decline in insect-pollinated plants. Seventy-six percent of forage plants declined in frequency within 1-km squares, including those (e.g. Trifolium pratense) of particular value for threatened bumblebee species. We consider how our ﬁndings relate to other recorded changes in the British ﬂora, how they may help to explain declines in bumblebees and how they could contribute to a conservation strategy.},

	abstract = {Abstract Background Siring success plays a key role in plant evolution and reproductive ecology, and variation among individuals creates an opportunity for selection to act. Differences in male reproductive success can be caused by processes that occur during two stages, the pollination and post-pollination phases of reproduction. In the pollination phase, heritable variation in floral traits and floral display affect pollinator visitation patterns, which in turn affect variation among plants in the amount of pollen exported and deposited on recipient stigmas. In the post-pollination phase, differences among individuals in pollen grain germination success and pollen tube growth may cause realized paternity to differ from patterns of pollen receipt. The maternal plant can also preferentially provision some developing seeds or fruits to further alter variation in siring success. Scope In this review, we describe studies that advance our understanding of the dynamics of the pollination and post-pollination phases, focusing on how variation in male fitness changes in response to pollen limitation. We then explore the interplay between pollination and post-pollination success, and how these processes respond to ecological factors such as pollination intensity. We also identify pressing questions at the intersection of pollination and paternity and describe novel experimental approaches to elucidate the relative importance of pollination and post-pollination factors in determining male reproductive success. Conclusions The relative contribution of pollination and post-pollination processes to variation in male reproductive success may not be constant, but rather may vary with pollination intensity. Studies that quantify the effects of pollination and post-pollination phases in concert will be especially valuable as they will enable researchers to more fully understand the ecological conditions influencing male reproductive success.},

	abstract = {Nearly all bees rely on pollen as the sole protein source for the development of their larvae. The central importance of pollen for the bee life cycle should exert strong selection on their ability to locate the most rewarding sources of pollen. Despite this importance, very few studies have examined the inﬂuence of intraspeciﬁc variation in pollen rewards on the foraging decisions of bees. Previous studies have demonstrated that inbreeding reduces viability and hence protein content in Mimulus guttatus (seep monkeyﬂower) pollen and that bees strongly discriminate against inbred in favour of outbred plants. We examined whether variation in pollen viability could explain this preference using a series of choice tests with living plants, artiﬁcial plants and olfactometer tests using the bumble bee Bombus impatiens. We found that B. impatiens preferred to visit artiﬁcial plants provisioned with fertile anthers over those provisioned with sterile anthers. They also preferred fertile anthers when provided only olfactory cues. These bumble bees were unable to discriminate among live plants from subpopulations differing dramatically in pollen viability, however. They preferred outbred plants even when those plants were from subpopulations with pollen viability as low as the inbred populations. Their preference for outbred plants was evident even when only olfactory cues were available. Our data showed that bumble bees are able to differentiate between anthers that provide higher rewards when cues are isolated from the rest of the ﬂower. When confronted with cues from the entire ﬂower, their choices are independent of the quality of the pollen reward, suggesting that they are responding more strongly to cues unassociated with rewards than to those correlated with rewards. If so, this suggests that a sensory bias or some level of deception may be involved with advertisement to pollinators in M. guttatus.},

	abstract = {Recently, some evolutionary biologists have argued that selection on the male component of fitness shapes the evolution of reproductive characters in angiosperms. Floral features, such as inflorescence size, that lead to increased insect visitation without a concomitant increase in seed production are viewed as adaptations to enhance the probability offathering seeds on other plants. In tests of this "pollen donation hypothesis," male reproductive success has usually been measured indirectly by flower production, pollinator visitation, or pollen removal. We tested the pollen donation hypothesis directly by quantifying the number of seeds sired by individual genotypes in a natural population of poke milkweed, Asclepias exaltata, in southwestern Virginia. Multiple paternity was low within fruits, a fact which allowed us to use genotypes ofprogeny arrays to identify a unique pollen parent for 85\% of the fruits produced in the population. Seeds sired (male success)and seeds produced (female success)were significantly correlated with flower number per plant (for male success, r = 0.32, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.05; for female success, r = 0.66, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). While the number of pollinaria removed, the usual estimator of male success in milkweeds, was highly correlated with numbers of seeds sired (r = 0.47; P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001), it was even more highly correlated with numbers of seeds produced (r = 0.71, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). Analysis of functional gender indicated that plants with many flowers did not behave primarily as males. In fact, individuals with the highest total reproductive success contributed equally as males and females. Furthermore, estimates of gender based on numbers of flowers produced or pollinaria removed overestimated the number of functional males in the population. In pollen-limited species, such as many milkweeds, proportional increases in both male and female reproductive success indicate the potential for selection to shape the evolution of large floral displays through both male and female functions.},

We estimated selection by pollinators and a predispersal seed predator on the three fundamental components of color (brightness, chroma, and hue) of Lobelia siphilitica ﬂowers. We compared phenotypic selection on ﬂowers of supplemental hand- versus open-pollinated plants to infer whether pollinators were an agent of selection on color. We compared attacked and unattacked plants to infer whether the seed predator was an agent of selection on color. Selection on brightness, but not chroma or hue, differed signiﬁcantly between both pollination treatments and predation categories. Both pollinators and the seed predator exerted selection for less bright ﬂowers, suggesting that they do not cause conﬂicting selection on ﬂower color. However, we also detected phenotypic selection for brighter ﬂowers that was not caused by pollinators or by the seed predator. Consequently, pollinators and herbivores are not sufﬁcient to generate conﬂicting selection that could contribute to the maintenance of ﬂower color variation in L. siphilitica.},

However, predictions regarding ﬂoral trait and mating system evolution are often based solely on female ﬁtness. Selection via male ﬁtness has the potential to affect the outcomes of ﬂoral evolution. In this study, we used paternity analysis to assess individual selﬁng rates and selection on ﬂoral traits via male and female ﬁtness in an experimental population of Clarkia xantiana where pollen limitation of seed set was strong. We detected selection through both female and male ﬁtness with reinforcing or noninterfering patterns of selection through the two sex functions. For female ﬁtness, selection favored reduced herkogamy and protandry, traits that promote increased autonomous selﬁng. For male ﬁtness, selection on petal area was disruptive, with higher trait values conferring greater pollinator attraction and outcross siring success and smaller trait values leading to higher selfed siring success. Combining both female and male ﬁtness, selection on petal area and protandry was disruptive because intermediate phenotypes were less successful as both males and females. Finally, functional relationships among male and female fertility components indicated that selﬁng resulted in seed discounting and pollen discounting. Under these functional relationships, the evolutionarily stable selﬁng rate can be intermediate or predominantly selﬁng or outcrossing, depending on the segregating load of deleterious mutations.},

	abstract = {The evolutionary causes of sexual dimorphism in plants have not been as widely studied as in animals and the importance of sexual selection in causing dimorphism remains controversial. Sexual selection is most obvious when it favours the evolution of a trait which enhances mating success at the expense of decreased viability. We studied the relationship between ¯oral display (number of in¯orescences), pollinator attraction and plant survival in a dioecious shrub, Leucadendron xanthoconus. Pollinator attraction, measured as the number of insect pollinators, increased linearly with ¯oral display in males. However, males with extravagant displays had a higher probability of dying. Our data suggest that male plants are undergoing selection on ¯oral display for increased mating success counterbalanced by selection against plants with extravagant displays. Seed set in females did not increase with ¯oral display, except at very low in¯orescence numbers. Nor was female survival correlated with ¯oral display. Because in¯orescences are terminal in the species, selection for more in¯orescences in males causes increased rami®cation, thinner terminal branches and smaller leaves. Thus vegetative dimorphism in this species appears to be caused by selection for extravagant ¯oral display in males, but not females. Limits to dimorphism are imposed by survival costs of elaborate display.},

From an evolutionary perspective, we discuss how pollen and ovule provisioning may be negatively genetically correlated and how this would maintain genetic variation for pollen performance within populations. Furthermore, the highly plastic nature of pollen performance provides the potential for genotypes to respond differently to environmental variation (genotype-environment interactions), which would also promote the maintenance of genetic variation in pollen performance.},

	abstract = {To understand the evolution of flowers and mating systems in animal-pollinated plants, we have to directly address the function for which flowers evolved—the movement of pollen from anthers to stigmas. However, despite a long history of making significant advances in our understanding natural selection and evolution, the field of pollination biology has largely studied pollen movement indirectly (e.g., pollen analogues or paternity assignment to seeds) due to a lack of suitable pollen tracking methods. Here, we develop and test a novel pollen-tracking technique using quantum dots as pollen-grain labels. Quantum dots are semiconductor nanocrystals so small in size that they behave like artificial atoms. When exposed to UV light, they emit extremely bright light in a range of different colours. Their photostability, broad excitation range, and customisable binding-ligands make quantum dots ideal bio-labels. We tested the suitability of CuInSexS2-x/ZnS (core/shell) quantum dots with oleic acid (zinc-oleate complex) ligands as pollen-grain labels. We found that quantum dots attach to pollen grains of four different species even after agitation in a polar solvent, suggesting that the oleic acid ligands on quantum dots bind to pollenkitt surrounding pollen grains. We also showed that most pollen grains within anthers of the same four species are labelled with quantum dots after applying sufficient quantum-dot solution to anthers. To test whether quantum-dot pollen-labels influenced pollen transport, we conducted pollen transfer trials on Sparaxis villosa (Iridaceae) using captively reared honeybees. We found no difference in pollen transport between labelled and unlabelled pollen grains. Our experiments therefore demonstrate the potential for quantum dots to be used as easily applied pollen labels, which allow subsequent tracking of the fates of pollen grains in the field. The ability to track pollen grain movement in situ, may finally allow us to address an historically neglected aspect of plant reproductive ecology and evolution.},

	abstract = {The ability to use chemical staining to discriminate aborted from non-aborted pollen grains has well-known practical applications in agriculture. A commonly used technique for assessing pollen vitality, Alexander’s stain, uses chloral hydrate, phenol and mercuric chloride, all of which are highly toxic. We describe here an improved pollen staining technique that avoids the use of a regulated chemical chloral hydrate and two extremely toxic chemicals mercuric chloride and phenol, and requires a much shorter time period for sample preparation and staining. This simplified method is very useful for field studies without high-end equipments such as fluorescence microscopes. Samples can be collected and fixed in the fields and examined in a simple laboratory that has light microscopes.},

	abstract = {The use of linear mixed effects models (LMMs) is increasingly common in the analysis of biological data. Whilst LMMs offer a ﬂexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the ﬁtting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.},

	abstract = {Paternity inference using highly polymorphic codominant markers is becoming common in the study of natural populations. However, multiple males are often found to be genetically compatible with each offspring tested, even when the probability of excluding an unrelated male is high. While various methods exist for evaluating the likelihood of paternity of each nonexcluded male, interpreting these likelihoods has hitherto been difficult, and no method takes account of the incomplete sampling and error-prone genetic data typical of large-scale studies of natural systems. We derive likelihood ratios for paternity inference with codominant markers taking account of typing error, and define a statistic ∆ for resolving paternity. Using allele frequencies from the study population in question, a simulation program generates criteria for ∆ that permit assignment of paternity to the most likely male with a known level of statistical confidence. The simulation takes account of the number of candidate males, the proportion of males that are sampled and gaps and errors in genetic data. We explore the potentially confounding effect of relatives and show that the method is robust to their presence under commonly encountered conditions. The method is demonstrated using genetic data from the intensively studied red deer (Cervus elaphus) population on the island of Rum, Scotland. The Windows-based computer program, CERVUS†, described in this study is available from the authors. CERVUS can be used to calculate allele frequencies, run simulations and perform parentage analysis using data from all types of codominant markers.},

Enduring interest in colour-based phenotypes has driven, and been driven by, improved techniques for quantifying colour patterns in ever-more relevant ways, yet the need for flexible, open frameworks for data processing and analysis persists. Here we introduce pavo 2, the latest iteration of the r package pavo. This release represents the extensive refinement and expansion of existing methods, as well as a suite of new tools for the cohesive analysis of the spectral and (now) spatial structure of colour patterns and perception. At its core, the package retains a broad focus on (a) the organization and processing of spectral and spatial data, and tools for the alternating (b) visualization, and (c) analysis of data. Significantly, pavo 2 introduces image-analysis capabilities, providing a cohesive workflow for the comprehensive analysis of colour patterns. We demonstrate the utility of pavo with a brief example centred on mimicry in Heliconius butterflies. Drawing on visual modelling, adjacency, and boundary strength analyses, we show that the combined spectral (colour and luminance) and spatial (pattern element distribution and boundary salience) features of putative models and mimics are closely aligned. pavo 2 offers a flexible and reproducible environment for the analysis of colour, with renewed potential to assist researchers in answering fundamental questions in sensory ecology and evolution.},

We analysed genetic parameters from crosses involving three populations of the dioecious plant Silene latifolia, which exhibits sexual dimorphism in ﬂower size, to determine whether population differentiation was a result of selection on one or both sexes. We took the novel approach of comparing the ratio of population differentiation of a quantitative trait (QST) to that of neutral genetic markers (FST) for males vs. females. We attributed 72.6\% of calyx width variation in males to differences among populations vs. only 6.9\% in females. The QST ⁄ FST ratio was 4.2 for males vs. 0.4 for females, suggesting that selection on males is responsible for differentiation among populations in calyx width and its degree of sexual dimorphism. This selection may be indirect via genetic correlations with other morphological and physiological traits.},

Now is a good time to reflect on the available techniques and to consider their strengths and weaknesses.

	abstract = {Resource allocation within individuals may often be hierarchical, and this may have important effects on genetic correlations and on trait evolution. For example, organisms may divide energy between reproduction and somatic growth and then subdivide reproductive resources. Genetic variation in allocation to pathways early in such hierarchies (e.g., reproduction) can cause positive genetic correlations between traits that trade off (e.g., offspring size and number) because some individuals invest more resources in reproduction than others. We used quantitative-genetic models to explore the evolutionary implications of allocation hierarchies. Our results showed that when variation in allocation early in the hierarchy exceeds subsequent variation in allocation, genetic covariances and initial responses to selection do not reﬂect trade-offs occurring at later levels in the hierarchy. This general pattern was evident for many starting allocations and optima and for whether traits contributed multiplicatively or additively to ﬁtness. Finally, artiﬁcial selection on a single trait revealed masked trade-offs when variation in early allocation was comparable to subsequent variation in allocation.

	abstract = {In insect-pollinated plants, ﬂoral characters are expected to play an important role in paternal and maternal reproductive success. Bateman’s principle states that male reproductive success increases with more mating opportunities, while female reproductive success is limited by the amount of resources available to produce progeny, thus there should be greater selection on male ﬂoral characters than on female. In the case of the dioecious plant Silene latifolia, ﬂoral characters are likely to be inﬂuenced by its association within its native European range with moths of the genus Hadena, which serve as both pollinators and seed predators. The present study addresses relationships between male and female reproductive success, spatial location and ﬂoral characters (corolla, calyx and claw) over a 2-year period in two Spanish populations of S. latifolia in the presence of Hadena moths. A maximum likelihood paternity analysis using genetic variation at six allozyme markers showed heterogeneity in male reproductive success. There was much less variation in female reproductive success. When this analysis was extended to include interplant distance as a causal factor underlying variation in male success, we found that successful pollination tended to be limited to nearby females, in accordance with exponential decay of pollen dispersal with increasing distance. When the paternity analysis included ﬂoral characters as a causal factor underlying variation in male success, our data showed little evidence for directional selection, but there was stabilizing selection in one of the two years for calyx diameter. Selection on female characters varied widely between sites and years, in most of the site/year combinations there was little selection on female ﬂoral characters; however, in one site/year there was evidence for selection on all three ﬂoral characters. We conclude that pollinators visit ﬂowers that are close together, and that while ﬂoral characters are important for the attraction of pollinators, larger ﬂowers do not necessarily attract more pollinators at all sites and that variation among sites and years makes difﬁcult any conclusions about the long-term importance of the predictions suggested by Bateman’s principle.},

	abstract = {Background: Sexual selection theory predicts that males are limited in their reproductive success by access to mates, whereas females are more limited by resources. In animal-pollinated plants, attraction of pollinators and successful pollination is crucial for reproductive success. In dioecious plant species, males should thus be selected to increase their attractiveness to pollinators by investing more than females in floral traits that enhance pollinator visitation. We tested the prediction of higher attractiveness of male flowers in the dioecious, moth-pollinated herb Silene latifolia, by investigating floral signals (floral display and fragrance) and conducting behavioral experiments with the pollinator-moth, Hadena bicruris. Results: As found in previous studies, male plants produced more but smaller flowers. Male flowers, however, emitted significantly larger amounts of scent than female flowers, especially of the pollinator-attracting compounds. In behavioral tests we showed that naïve pollinator-moths preferred male over female flowers, but this preference was only significant for male moths. Conclusion: Our data suggest the evolution of dimorphic floral signals is shaped by sexual selection and pollinator preferences, causing sexual conflict in both plants and pollinators.},

	abstract = {When populations are partially inbred due to the population structure or to a mixed mating system like partial self-fertilization, some individuals will be more inbred than others. This heterogeneity among individuals in the history of inbreeding can greatly complicate the interpretation of measures of quantitative genetic variability when the traits studied exhibit inbreeding depression. Partial inbreeding can also bias measures of phenotypic selection toward the detection of strong directional and stabilizing selection. In this paper, data are presented from several inbreeding experiments conducted on two partially selfing, annual populations of the monkeyflower Mimulus guttatus that show that the means of many of the morphological and phenological traits measured were affected by inbreeding. These findings imply that estimates of heritabilities and additive genetic covariances would not reflect the potential for these populations to respond to selection, Phenotypic selection analyses conducted on naturally occurring plants, involving linear regressions of relative seed production on the traits, revealed significant directional selection on many of the same quantitative traits measured in the inbreeding studies. However, when the same selection analyses were performed on plants with known histories of inbreeding, part of the statistical relationship between relative seed number and the traits was found to be due to the mating system: inbred individuals had both lower seed production and different mean values for the traits than outcrossed individuals. It is also shown, with a hypothetical example, that partial inbreeding can bias measures of stabilizing selection toward the detection of strong stabilizing selection. Partial inbreeding therefore tends to make directional and stabilizing selection appear stronger than it is, and it may be that natural selection in the wild is actually weaker than many studies of partially inbred species suggest.},

Flower-visiting and nectar feeding behavoiur in insects from three orders of class insect Lepidoptera, hymenoptera and diptera was observed. Both form and function of mouthparts are noted and described in detail. The process of nectar intake is discussed based on significant differences noted in nectar search, foraging time budget and feeding efficiency, choice of plant and floral architecture. With this remarkable differences in maxillary motions, and orientation behavior found in insects during foraging are also discussed. Based on observations made, nectar feeding in insects is a biphasic mechanism, in first phase insects made active searches for finding nectar, while in second phase they were observed trying to establish communication among con-specifics by making different sounds, or through scented marks left on the flowers visited or spread pollens in the air to signal the con-specifics. With this search, operations and communication patterns were found to be influenced by humidity, temperature and photoperiodicity in the territory, while chemical composition of nectar significantly affected the oviposition responses and F1 emergence in Utetheisa pulcheloides (Heliotrope Moth).},

	abstract = {The main drivers of global environmental change (CO2 enrichment, nitrogen deposition, climate, biotic invasions and land use) cause extinctions and alter species distributions, and recent evidence shows that they exert pervasive impacts on various antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among species. In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent ﬁnding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions.},

Information from molecular genetic markers can be used to assess determinants of male mating success through parentage analyses. We estimated paternal selection gradients on ﬂoral traits in a large natural population of the herb Mimulus guttatus using a paternity probability model and maximum likelihood methods. This analysis revealed more signiﬁcant selection gradients than a previous analysis based on regression of estimated male fertilities on ﬂoral traits. There were differences between results of univariate and multivariate analyses most likely due to the underlying covariance structure of the traits. Multivariate analysis, which corrects for the covariance structure of the traits, indicated that male mating success declined with distance from and depended on the direction to the mother plants. Moreover, there was directional selection for plants with fewer open ﬂowers which have smaller corollas, a smaller anther–stigma separation, more red dots on the corolla and a larger ﬂuctuating asymmetry therein. For most of these traits, however, there was also stabilizing selection indicating that there are intermediate optima for these traits. The large number of signiﬁcant selection gradients in this study shows that even in relatively large natural populations where not all males can be sampled, it is possible to detect signiﬁcant paternal selection gradients, and that such studies can give us valuable information required to better understand adaptive plant evolution.},

	abstract = {Global change is expected to impose new selection pressures on natural populations. Phenotypic responses, such as earlier phenology in response to climate warming, have been repeatedly observed in the ﬁeld. The recent pollinator decline is also expected to change selection on reproductive traits in ﬂowering plants. However, it remains unclear whether short-term adaptation of plant reproductive strategies occurs in response to global change. In this study, we report the evolution of some important reproductive traits of the annual self-incompatible weed Centaurea cyanus. In a common garden experiment, we germinated stored seeds, sampled 18 years apart from the same location, in a region where warmer springs and indices of pollinator decline have been reported. Compared to the ancestral population (1992), our results showed that plants of the descendant population (2010) ﬂowered earlier and also produced larger capitula with longer receptivity and a larger ﬂoral display. QST–FST comparisons indicated that natural selection has likely contributed to the evolution of some of the traits investigated. Lower FST within temporal samples than among spatial samples further suggests a limited role of gene ﬂow from neighbouring populations. We therefore propose that trait shifts could partly be due to adaptation to global change.},

	abstract = {Data on multiple paternity within broods has been gathered in several animal species, and comparable data in plants would be of great importance to understand the evolution of reproductive traits in a common framework. In this study, we first isolated and characterized six microsatellite loci from the dioecious plant Silene latifolia (Caryophyllaceae). The polymorphism of the loci was assessed in 60 individual females from four different populations. Two of the investigated loci showed a pattern of inheritance consistent with X-linkage. These microsatellite loci were highly polymorphic and therefore useful tools for parentage analysis. We then used four of the markers to determine paternity within naturally pollinated fruits in four European populations. This study revealed widespread multiple paternity in all populations investigated. The minimum number of fathers per fruit varied from one to nine, with population means ranging from 3.4 to 4.9. The number of fathers per fruit was not significantly correlated with offspring sex ratios. High prevalence of multiple paternity within fruits strongly suggest that pollen competition is likely to occur in this species. This may substantially impact male reproductive success and possibly contribute to increase female and offspring fitness, either through postpollination selection or increased genetic diversity. Wide variation in outcrossing rates may be an overlooked aspect of plant mating systems.},

We conclude that Bateman’s results are unreliable, his conclusions are questionable, and his observed variances are similar to those expected under random mating. Despite our analysis, we do not intend this article as a criticism of Bateman; he accomplished his work without modern computational tools, and his approach was groundbreaking emphasizing the signiﬁcance of ﬁtness variance for sexual selection. However, this reanalysis has implications for what counts as evidence for sexual selection and we believe that our concerns should be of interest to contemporary students of sexual selection.

	abstract = {The link between biotic interaction intensity and strength of selection is of fundamental interest for understanding biotically driven diversification and predicting the consequences of environmental change. The strength of selection resulting from biotic interactions is determined by the strength of the interaction and by the covariance between fitness and the trait under selection. When the relationship between trait and absolute fitness is constant, selection strength should be a direct function of mean population interaction intensity. To test this prediction, we excluded pollinators for intervals of different length to induce five levels of pollination intensity within a single plant population. Pollen limitation (PL) increased from 0 to 0.77 across treatments, accompanied by a fivefold increase in the opportunity for selection. Trait–fitness covariance declined with PL for number of flowers, but varied little for other traits. Pollinator-­ mediated selection on plant height, corolla size, and spur length increased by 91\%, 34\%, and 330\%, respectively, in the most severely pollen-­limited treatment compared to open-­pollinated plants. The results indicate that realized biotic selection can be predicted from mean population interaction intensity when variation in trait–fitness covariance is limited, and that declines in pollination intensity will strongly increase selection on traits involved in the interaction.},

Today the concept has been developed and various other sexually related traits have been suggested to evolve in the same manner. In nearly all new areas where the theory of sexual selection has been applied, there has been an intense debate as to whether the application is justiﬁed. Is it the case that some scientists are all too ready to employ fashionable ideas ? Or are there too many dogmatic researchers refusing to accept that science develops and old ideas are transformed? Maybe the controversies are simply a reﬂection of the diﬃculty of deﬁning a theory under constant re-evaluation. Thus, we begin by summarizing the theory of sexual selection in order to assess the inﬂuence of sexual selection on the evolution of plant morphology. We discuss empirical ﬁndings concerning potentially aﬀected traits. Although we have tried to address criticisms fairly, we still conclude that sexual selection can be a useful tool when studying the evolution of reproductive traits in plants. Furthermore, by including the evidence from an additional kingdom, a fuller understanding of the processes involved in sexual selection can be gained.},

Developing a framework for the diversity of signals has important consequences for understanding alternative models of sexual selection and the processes contributing to speciation.

We discuss how the distinction between additive and multiplicative effects of multimodal signaling represents a second step. We then assess how signal efﬁciency, reliability, and the aesthetics of perceivers provide distinct mechanisms for signals to be effective, thereby partly explaining signal diversity. Understanding the relative contribution of each of these mechanisms to the effectiveness of mate choice signals unravels the relative importance of alternative models of sexual selection. It can also help to distinguish whether divergence of communication is a driver or a consequence of speciation. Throughout the review we emphasize the importance of veriﬁcation and learning in repeated interactions for understanding variation in signals.},

	abstract = {Plants involved in specialized pollinator interactions, such as nursery pollination, may experience tradeoffs in their female fitness, as the larvae of their pollinators may also consume seeds produced by the flowers they pollinate. These interactions could potentially shift between mutualism and parasitism, depending on the presence and abundance of both the nursery pollinator and of other pollinators. We investigated the fitness trade-off in a Mediterranean plant (Silene latifolia), which has a specialist nocturnal nursery pollinator moth (Hadena bicruris) and is also visited by several diurnal pollinators. We estimated the pollination rates and fecundity of S. latifolia in both natural and experimental populations in the Mediterranean. We estimated natural pollination rates in different flowering times and with presence/absence of the H. bicruis moth. Then by exposing plants to each pollinator group either during the day or at night, we quantified the contribution of other diurnal pollinators and the specialized nocturnal nursery pollinator to plant female fitness. We found no difference in plant fruit set mediated by diurnal versus nocturnal pollinators, indicating that non-specialist pollinators contribute to plant female fitness. However, in both natural and experimental populations, H. bicruris was the most efficient pollinator in terms of seeds produced per fruit. These results suggest that the female fitness costs generated by nursery pollination can be overcome through higher fertilization rates relative to predation rates, even in the presence of co-pollinators. Quantifying such interactions is important for our understanding of the selective pressures that promote highly specialized mutualisms, such as nursery pollination, in the Mediterranean region, a centre of diversification of the carnation family.},

This reputation arises from observations that species differ most in traits involved with mating success and from successful models of sexual selection–driven speciation. But how well proven is the case? Models conﬁrm that the process can occur, but is strongest in conjunction with ecological or niche specialization. Some models also show that strong sexual selection can act against speciation. Studies using the comparative method are equivocal and often inconclusive, but some phylogeographic studies are more convincing. Experimental evolution and genetic or genomic analyses are in their infancy, but look particularly promising for resolving the importance of sexual selection. The case for sexual selection is not as strongly supported as, for example, allopatric speciation. Sexual selection probably contributes most effectively alongside ecological selection or selection for species recognition than as a solitary process.},

	abstract = {Flower scents are complex blends of volatile compounds often shaped by selection pressures exerted by mutualistic and antagonistic interaction partners, but also by phylogenetic constraints. So far, little is known about the relative effect of selection and phylogenetic signal on scent patterns, and no study to date analyzed the phylogenetic signal in multivariate semiquantitative scent patterns. We analyzed the phylogenetic signal in qualitative and semi-quantitative patterns of ﬂower scents in 47 Sileneae (Caryophyllaceae) species using phylogenetic principal component analysis (pPCA) and several indices of univariate and multivariate phylogenetic signal. As previous results showed that Sileneae species are visited by diurnal and nocturnal pollinators and ﬂower scents also vary along the day, we compared the phylogenetic signal between night and day. Multivariate pPCA analyses identiﬁed compounds that correlate with the phylogeny at both night and day; however, multivariate Bloomberg0s K detected phylogenetic signal in the dataset of night scents, but not of day scents. In multivariate qualitative datasets, phylogenetic signal was neither found for day nor for night scents. In univariate analyses, phylogenetic signal was detected for some compounds both for day and night scents. Overall, we found that the phylogenetic signal is stronger in night compared to day scents, which might be owed to the different guilds of pollinators at day and night. At day, the phylogenetic resemblance of Sileneae scents might be masked by or disappear due to divergent selective pressures exerted by a diverse guild of pollinators on the different species. In contrast, we hypothesize that the nocturnal moth pollinators exert similar selective pressures; thus, the phylogenetic similarity of scent proﬁles might be conserved. Future studies of scent phylogenetic signal must consider not only the usage of qualitative measures but also semiquantitative analyses.},

	abstract = {Even though the importance of selection for trait evolution is well established, we still lack a functional understanding of the mechanisms underlying phenotypic selection. Because animals necessarily use their sensory system to perceive phenotypic traits, the model of sensory bias assumes that sensory systems are the main determinant of signal evolution. Yet, it has remained poorly known how sensory systems contribute to shaping the ﬁtness surface of selected individuals. In a greenhouse experiment, we quantiﬁed the strength and direction of selection on ﬂoral coloration in a population of cornﬂowers exposed to bumblebees as unique pollinators during 4 days. We detected signiﬁcant selection on the chromatic and achromatic (brightness) components of ﬂoral coloration. We then studied whether these patterns of selection are explicable by accounting for the visual system of the pollinators. Using data on bumblebee colour vision, we ﬁrst showed that bumblebees should discriminate among quantitative colour variants. The observed selection was then compared to the selection predicted by psychophysical models of bumblebee colour vision. The achromatic but not the chromatic channel of the bumblebee’s visual system could explain the observed pattern of selection. These results highlight that (i) pollinators can select quantitative variation in ﬂoral coloration and could thus account for a gradual evolution of ﬂower coloration, and (ii) stimulation of the visual system represents, at least partly, a functional mechanism potentially explaining pollinators’ selection on ﬂoral colour variants.},

	abstract = {Hay harvests have detrimental ecological effects on breeding songbirds, as harvesting results in nest failure. Importantly, whether harvesting also affects evolutionary processes is not known. We explored how hay harvest affected social and genetic mating patterns, and thus, the overall opportunity for sexual selection and evolutionary processes for a groundnesting songbird, the Savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis). On an unharvested field, 55\% of females were in polygynous associations, and social polygyny was associated with greater rates of extra-pair paternity (EPP). In this treatment, synchrony explained variation in EPP rates, as broods by more synchronous females had more EPP than broods by asynchronous females. In contrast, on a harvested field, simultaneous nest failure caused by haying dramatically decreased the overall incidence of EPP by increasing the occurrence of social monogamy and, apparently, the ability of polygynous males to maintain paternity in their own nests. Despite increased social and genetic monogamy, these hayingmediated changes in mating systems resulted in greater than twofold increase in the opportunity for sexual selection. This effect arose, in part, from a 30\% increase in the variance associated with within-pair fertilization success, relative to the unharvested field. This effect was caused by a notable increase (+110\%) in variance associated with the quality of social mates following simultaneous nest failure. Because up to 40\% of regional habitat is harvested by early June, these data may demonstrate a strong population-level effect on mating systems, sexual selection, and consequently, evolutionary processes.},

	abstract = {Nectar is a common reward provided by plants for pollinators. More concentrated nectar is more rewarding, but also more viscous, and hence more time-consuming to drink. Consequently, theory predicts an optimum concentration for maximising energy uptake rate, dependent on the mechanics of feeding. For social pollinators such as bumblebees, another important but little-studied aspect of foraging is nectar offloading upon return to the nest. Studying the bumblebee Bombus terrestris, we found that the relationship between viscosity (µ) and volumetric transfer rates (Q) of sucrose solutions differed between drinking and offloading. For drinking, Q ∝ µ-0.180, in good agreement with previous work. Although offloading was quicker than drinking, offloading rate decreased faster with viscosity, with Q ∝ µ-0.502; consistent with constraints imposed by fluid flow through a tube. The difference in mechanics between drinking and offloading nectar leads to a conflict in the optimum concentration for maximising energy transfer rates. Building a model of foraging energetics, we show that including offloading lowers the maximum rate of energy return to the nest and reduces the concentration which maximises this rate by around 3 \%. Using our model we show that published values of preferred nectar sugar concentrations suggest that bumblebees maximise the overall energy return rather than the instantaneous energy uptake during drinking.},

	abstract = {The Silene mollissima (L.) Pers. aggregate is part of section Siphonomorpha Otth. and currently comprises 11 narrow endemic species of the Western Mediterranean Basin. Three of these taxa (S. velutina Pourr. ex Loisel, S. ichnusae Brullo, De Marco \& De Marco f., and S. badaroi Breistr.) have a distribution range centred in the northern Tyrrhenian area and occurring in coastal habitats. Inter- and intra-speciﬁc variability in the responses to light, constant (5–25 °C) and alternating temperatures (25/10 °C), salt (NaCl, 0–600 mmol/L), and levels of nitrate (KNO3, 20 mmol/L) under salt stress, as well as recovery of seed germination were evaluated for these species to more effectively support their in-situ and ex-situ conservation. Our results highlighted that the seeds of these three taxa were nondormant, and that light signiﬁcantly improved their rate of germination, which was higher ({\textbackslash}textgreater80\%) at low temperatures (5–15 °C) and under the alternating temperature regime (25/10 °C), but decreased signiﬁcantly at the highest temperature tested (25 °C). Seeds from Silene velutina and S. ichnusae germinated in up to 300 mmol/L NaCl, and S. badaroi germinated in up to 100 mmol/L. For all of the species except S. badaroi, salt did not affect seed viability, and recovery germination did not decrease with increasing salinity and temperature. Interpopulation variability, both in salt tolerance and recovery germination, was detected for S. velutina. The addition of KNO3 did not affect germination or recovery germination under salt conditions. The lack of effect from KNO3 suggests that nutrient availability is not a requirement for seed germination in these species. Our results show that all species experience an optimum period of germination during autumn–winter, which is when water availability is highest and soil salinity levels are minimal because of the Mediterranean rainfalls, but seeds from S. velutina and S. ichnusae will germinate up until spring.},

This essay review presents some key issues in reproductive allocation by examining problems of allocation at different hierarchical levels within plant. At the whole plant level, the application of ‘Rensch’s rule’ to plants is discussed as a mechanism that might explain size differences in relation to gender in dioecious species. At branch level, the existence of vegetative branches may be explained by hypotheses on branch specialization and costs of reproduction. However, vegetative branches might also constitute an ‘assurance’ for reproduction in variable environments. At a lower hierarchical level, fruit abortion is a process widely observed in plants that impose limits to our capacity to estimate and develop general laws about reproductive allocation in plants. The question of whether fruit abortion can be used by the parent to produce a more homogeneous progeny that limits asymmetric competition among sibs is discussed. Finally, it seems that in some cases the allocation within seeds is in accordance with some predictions of kin selection theory. Most of these topics contain open questions that deserve further research.},

After critically evaluating previous data provided to support this hypothesis, I suggest on both theoretical grounds and on re-analysis that this argument is unlikely and unsupported. Leaf size dimorphism could theoretically evolve directly due to disruptive ecological selection between genders, leading to niche dimorphism either within or between habitats. I test this ecological causation hypothesis by providing data on specific leaf area (sla) and water use efficiency (δ 13C) of leaves from males and females of several Leucadendron species. Results confirm the expectation of minimal gender differences. I argue that leaf dimorphism is a consequence of selection on flower size and architecture.},

	abstract = {It is well documented that the mother plant has much more influence than the father on seed dormancy/germination, especially of the F1 offspring, primarily by providing all material (maternally derived tissue) to the diaspore coat(s); by maternal environmental effects and provisioning of nutrient resources, mRNA transcripts, protein, the hormone abscisic acid and nitrate to the seed during its development; and by determining progeny environment via dispersal and phenology. There is some evidence that the paternal influence on seed dormancy/ germination of the offspring (seeds) can be mediated through multiple paternity (including mate number and diversity), non-nuclear (cytoplasmic) and nuclear (genotypic) inheritance and paternal environmental effects. Our primary aim was to determine via a literature review the influence (or not) of the paternal parent on seed germination. Altogether, 37 of 59 studies (62.7\%) indicated a positive influence of the father on seed germination, although not all of them were statistically significant. In general, however, results of studies reported in the literature do not offer strong support for the paternal parent having a major role in seed germination (or seed size) of his F1 offspring.},

	abstract = {Stronger pollen limitation should increase competition among plants, leading to stronger selection on traits important for pollen receipt. The few explicit tests of this hypothesis, however, have provided conﬂicting support. Using the arithmetic relationship between these two quantities, we show that increased pollen limitation will automatically result in stronger selection (all else equal) although other factors can alter selection independently of pollen limitation. We then tested the hypothesis using two approaches. First, we analysed the published studies containing information on both pollen limitation and selection. Second, we explored how natural selection measured in one Ontario population of Lobelia cardinalis over 3 years and two Michigan populations in 1 year relates to pollen limitation. For the Ontario population, we also explored whether pollinator-mediated selection is related to pollen limitation. Consistent with the hypothesis, we found an overall positive relationship between selection strength and pollen limitation both among species and within L. cardinalis. Unexpectedly, this relationship was found even for vegetative traits among species, and was not found in L. cardinalis for pollinator-mediated selection on nearly all trait types.},

Plants with different degrees of sexual dimorphism are thus ideal to study the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism. In this study we explore the genetic architecture of sexual dimorphism between Silene latifolia and Silene dioica. These species have chromosomal sex determination and differ in the extent of sexual dimorphism. To test whether QTL for sexually dimorphic traits have accumulated on the sex chromosomes and to quantify their contribution to species differences, we create a linkage map and performed QTL analysis of life history, flower and vegetative traits using an unidirectional interspecific F2 hybrid cross. We found support for an accumulation of QTL on the sex chromosomes and that sex differences explained a large proportion of the variance between species, suggesting that both natural and sexual selection contributed to species divergence. Sexually dimorphic traits that also differed between species displayed transgressive segregation. We observed a reversal in sexual dimorphism in the F2 population, where males tended to be larger than females, indicating that sexual dimorphism is constrained within populations but not in recombinant hybrids. This study contributes to the understanding of the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism and its evolution in Silene.},

	abstract = {Mating in seed plants arises from interactions between plant traits and the environmental and demographic context in which individuals reside. These interactions commonly cause nonrandom mating, including selﬁng and promiscuous outcrossing within local neighborhoods. Shared features of seed plants, speciﬁcally immobility, hermaphroditism, and modularity, shape the essential character of mating mediated by animals, wind, and water. In addition, diverse ﬂoral strategies promote cross- and self-mating, depending on environmental circumstances. Extrinsic ecological factors inﬂuence all stages of the mating process—pollination, pollen-tube growth, ovule fertilization—as well as seed development, determining offspring quantity and quality. Traditionally, measures of plant mating systems have focused on a single axis of variation, the maternal outcrossing rate. Instead, we argue for an expanded perspective encompassing mating portfolios, which include all offspring to which individuals contribute genetically as maternal or paternal parents. This approach should expose key ecological determinants of mating-system variation and their evolutionary consequences.},

	abstract = {We explored the idea that sex ratio represents a unique context for selection on attractive traits by manipulating sex ratio and pollinator abundance in experimental populations of a genderdimorphic wild strawberry Fragaria virginiana. We found that increasing the frequency of functional males (the pollen-bearing morph) increased the frequency of pollen-collecting syrphid ﬂies in the pollinator assemblage, decreased pollinator visitation to less preferred morph (females), and decreased the degree of pollen limitation of females. Moreover, sex ratio inﬂuenced the strength of selection on petal size through female ﬁtness but did not alter the strength of selection through male ﬁtness components, suggesting that sex ratio can alter the gender bias of selection on an attractive trait. This study of context-dependent selection has important implications for the evolution of sexual dimorphism in attractive traits. First, it suggests that only certain conditions generate male-biased selection and, thus, could lead to selection-driven male-biased petal size dimorphism. Second, it suggests that ﬂexible pollinator foraging may be an important mechanism by which sex ratio inﬂuences selection on attractive traits. Finally, it implies that variation in sex ratio could limit the evolution of sexual dimorphism and/or could maintain genetic variation in attractive traits.},

	abstract = {Natural selection arising from resource competition and environmental heterogeneity can drive adaptive radiation. Ecological opportunity facilitates this process, resulting in rapid divergence of ecological traits in many celebrated radiations. In other cases, sexual selection is thought to fuel divergence in mating signals ahead of ecological divergence. Comparing divergence rates between naturally and sexually selected traits can offer insights into processes underlying species radiations, but to date such comparisons have been largely qualitative. Here, we quantitatively compare divergence rates for four traits in African mormyrid ﬁshes, which use an electrical communication system with few extrinsic constraints on divergence. We demonstrate rapid signal evolution in the Paramormyrops species ﬂock compared to divergence in morphology, size, and trophic ecology. This disparity in the tempo of trait evolution suggests that sexual selection is an important early driver of species radiation in these mormyrids. We also found slight divergence in ecological traits among closely related species, consistent with a supporting role for natural selection in Paramormyrops diversiﬁcation. Our results highlight the potential for sexual selection to drive explosive signal divergence when innovations in communication open new opportunities in signal space, suggesting that opportunity can catalyze species radiations through sexual selection, as well as natural selection.},

Morphology and function of different parts of Coronilla emerus L. flowers were related to their role in the pollination mechanism. The corolla has a vexillum with red nectar lines, a keel hiding stamens and pistil, and two wing petals fasten to the keel with two notched folds. Pollinators land on the complex of keel and wings, trigger the protrusion of pollen and finally of the stigma from the keel tip. Data on pollen viability and stigma receptivity prove that flowers are proterandrous. The results of hand-pollination experiments confirmed that insects are fundamental to set seed. Interaction with pollinators allows not only the transport of pollen but also the rupture of the stigmatic cuticle, necessary to achieve both allogamy and autogamy. Field observations showed that Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, and Diptera visited the flowers. Only some of the Hymenoptera landed on the flowers from the front and elicited pollination mechanisms. Most of the insects sucked the nectar from the back without any pollen transfer. Finally, morphological and functional characteristics of C. emerus flowers are discussed in terms of floral larceny and reduction in pollination efficiency.},

To address these issues, we established eight replicate populations of native common evening primrose (Oenothera biennis). Each population was planted with 18 genotypes in identical frequency. By tracking genotype frequencies with microsatellite DNA markers over the subsequent three years (up to three generations, ≈5,000 genotyped plants), we show rapid and consistent evolution of two heritable plant life-history traits (shorter life span and later ﬂowering time). This rapid evolution was only partially the result of differential seed production; genotypic variation in seed germination also contributed to the observed evolutionary response. Since evening primrose genotypes exhibited heritable variation for resistance to insect herbivores, which was related to ﬂowering time, we predicted that evolutionary changes in genotype frequencies would feed back to inﬂuence populations of a seed predator moth that specializes on O. biennis. By the conclusion of the experiment, variation in the genotypic composition among our eight replicate ﬁeld populations was highly predictive of moth abundance. These results demonstrate how rapid evolution in ﬁeld populations of a native plant can inﬂuence ecological interactions.},

	abstract = {Paternal, rather than maternal, ®tness consequences of reproductive traits are the lynchpin in many hypotheses about reproductive evolution in hermaphroditic angiosperms. These hypotheses often differ in their predictions, so that supporting or contradictory evidence for one hypothesis may not re¯ect similarly on another, even though both may be referred to as `the male function hypothesis'. We provide graphical representations of four male function hypotheses from the recent literature in order to highlight their differences. We offer and explain two recommendations to reduce ambiguity in terminology: (1) male function hypotheses should address the evolution of excess ¯owers per se, rather than total ¯ower number, which is usually highly plastic in modular organisms with open growth form; and (2) attention must be given to whole plant ®tness, rather than ®tness per ¯ower or per in¯orescence. In empirical studies, we recommend the use of path analysis to dissect the multiple pathways (through both male and female function) by which selection may act on excess ¯ower number.},

	abstract = {Why do males and females frequently differ so markedly in body size and morphology? Sex, Size, and Gender Roles is the first book to investigate the genetic, developmental, and physiological basis of sexual size dimorphism found within and among the major taxonomic groups of animals. Carefully edited by a team of world-renowned specialists in the field to ensure a coherence of style and approach between chapters, it presents a compendium of studies into the evolution, adaptive significance, and developmental basis of gender differences in body size and morphology. Adaptive hypotheses allude to gender-specific reproductive roles and associated differences in trophic ecologies, life history strategies, and sexual selection. This "adaptationist" approach is balanced by more mechanistic studies of the genetic, developmental and physiological basis of sexual size dimorphism to provide a comprehensive and authoritative overview of the subject. Throughout the volume the emphasis is on sexual dimorphism in overall size; however, the scope of enquiry encompasses gender differences in body shape, the size and structure of secondary sexual characteristics, patterns of growth (ontogeny), and patterns of gene regulation. This advanced, research level text is suitable for graduate level students and researchers in the fields of evolutionary biology, behavioural ecology, physiology, developmental biology, and genetics. It will also be of relevance and use to non-biologists from fields such as anthropology and gender studies.},

Chapters integrate conceptual and theoretical approaches with recent empirical advances to understand the evolution of behavior, from foraging, dealing with risk, predator avoidance, and an array of social behaviors, including fighting and cooperation with conspecifics and conflict and cooperation between the sexes. Chapters also emphasize integrative and novel approaches to behavior, including cognitive ecology, personality, conservation biology, the links between behavior and evolution, the evolution of human social behavior, and ways in which modern genetic analyses can augment the study of behavior.},

Even in the absence ofgenetic instability, rapid evolution can result from an interaction of natural and sexual selection with random genetic drift along lines of equilibria. The models elucidate genetic mechanisms that can initiate or contribute to rapid speciation by sexual isolation and divergence of secondary sexual characters.},

	abstract = {Specialization in plant–insect interactions is an important driver of evolutionary divergence; yet, plant traits mediating such interactions are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how flower color and floral scent are related to seed predation by a seed-eating pollinator. We used field-transplanted recombinant F2 hybrids between Silene latifolia and S. dioica that are the preferred and alternative hosts of the moth Hadena bicruris and crosses within these species for comparison. We scored seed predation and flower color and analyzed floral scent. Pinker S. dioica-like flowers and emission of a-pinene decreased the odds of seed predation while emission of benzyl acetate and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one increased the odds of seed predation. Emission of these compounds did not differ significantly between the two Silene species. Our results suggest that flower color plays an important role in the specific interaction of H. bicruris with its preferred host S. latifolia. The compounds a-pinene, benzyl acetate and 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one could represent non-specific deterrents and attractants to ovipositing moths. Alternatively, emission of these compounds could be related to herbivory or pathogen attack and act as a signal for host quality. This would weaken the predictability of the plant’s costs and benefits of the interaction and act to maintain an imperfect degree of specialization.},

	abstract = {The presence of anthocyanins in ﬂowers and fruits is frequently attributed to attracting pollinators and dispersers. In vegetative organs, anthocyanins and other non-pigmented ﬂavonoids such as ﬂavones and ﬂavonols may serve protective functions against UV radiation, cold, heat, drought, salinity, pathogens, and herbivores; thus, these compounds are usually produced as a plastic response to such stressors. Although, the independent accumulation of anthocyanins in reproductive and vegetative tissues is commonly postulated due to differential regulation, the accumulation of ﬂavonoids within and among populations has never been thoroughly compared. Here, we investigated the shore campion (Silene littorea, Caryophyllaceae) which exhibits variation in anthocyanin accumulation in its ﬂoral and vegetative tissues. We examined the in-situ accumulation of ﬂavonoids in ﬂoral (petals and calyxes) and vegetative organs (leaves) from 18 populations representing the species’ geographic distribution. Each organ exhibited considerable variability in the content of anthocyanins and other ﬂavonoids both within and among populations. In all organs, anthocyanin and other ﬂavonoids were correlated. At the plant level, the ﬂavonoid content in petals, calyxes, and leaves was not correlated in most of the populations. However, at the population level, the mean amount of anthocyanins in all organs was positively correlated, which suggests that the variable environmental conditions of populations may play a role in anthocyanin accumulation. These results are unexpected because the anthocyanins are usually constitutive in petals, yet contingent to environmental conditions in calyxes and leaves. Anthocyanin variation in petals may inﬂuence pollinator attraction and subsequent plant reproduction, yet the amount of anthocyanins may be a direct response to environmental factors. In populations on the west coast, a general pattern of increasing accumulation of ﬂavonoids toward southern latitudes was observed in calyxes and leaves. This pattern corresponds to a gradual increase of UV-B radiation and temperature, and a decrease of rainfall toward the south. However, populations along the southern coast exposed to similar climatic stressors showed highly variable ﬂavonoid contents, implying that other factors may play a role in ﬂavonoid accumulation.},

We discuss statistical and biological issues that may arise in applications of Lande and Arnold's (1983) multiple-regression approach to measuring selection, We review assumptions involved in estimation and hypothesis testing in regression problems, and we note difficulties that frequently arise as a result of violation of these assumptions. In particular, multicollinearity (extreme intercorrelation of characters) and extrinsic, unmeasured factors affecting fitness may seriously complicate inference regarding selection, Further, violation of the assumption that residuals are normally distributed vitiates tests of significance. For this situation, we suggest applications of recently developed jackknife tests of significance, While fitness regression permits direct assessment of selection in a form suitable for predicting selection response, we suggest that the aim of inferring causal relationships about the effects of phenotypic characters on fitness is greatly facilitated by manipulative experiments. Finally, we discuss alternative definitions of stabilizing and disruptive selection.},

	abstract = {The reproductive biology of the dioecious understorey palm Chamaedorea radicalis was investigated in order to identify the primary pollen vector and quantify the relationship between female fecundity and local neighbourhood sexual composition. The study was conducted in a montane mesophyll forest within the El Cielo Biosphere Reserve, Tamaulipas, Mexico. The species is considered vulnerable in Mexico and there are concerns about the sustainability of leaf harvest. We determined that wind is the primary pollen vector, based both on floral and pollen morphological characters, and on a pollinator exclosure experiment. Successful wind pollination of this understorey palm was facilitated by the extended flowering period of males, which allows one male to be a source of pollen to receptive females for as long as a month. The number of flowers and fruits borne on a female were dependent on female size, however, no size parameter correlated well with fruit set. Fruit set was also not dependent on local sexual composition, male density or distance to the nearest male, suggesting that in this study area female reproductive success is not limited by the availability of pollen.},

	abstract = {METHODS: We studied the effect of simulated pollinator declines on selection on floral traits of Impatiens capensis, a mixed-mating species that produces both obligately selfing cleistogamous flowers and primarily outcrossing chasmogamous flowers. We measured directional selection differentials via seeds per plant on two traits that facilitate outcrossing (chasmogamous flower size and number) and one trait that facilitates selfing (cleistogamous flower number) in ambient, reduced pollinator access, and reduced pollinator access combined with increased foliar herbivory treatments. RESULTS: Reduced pollinator access intensified selection for larger chasmogamous flowers and more cleistogamous flowers. In contrast, increased herbivory did not affect selection on any floral trait. CONCLUSIONS: Reduced pollinator access intensified selection for a trait that facilitates outcrossing, suggesting that even species such as I. capensis that can autonomously selfpollinate have the potential to respond to pollinator declines by evolving floral traits that reinforce interactions between plants and pollinators. However, reduced pollinator access also intensified selection for a trait that facilitates selfing, suggesting that I. capensis could adapt to pollinator declines by evolving floral traits that maintain the production of both selfed and outcrossed seeds.},

Here, we explored the photoprotection hypothesis in Silene germana, a Mediterranean annual plant with late-spring/summer flowering.  We analyzed the temporal patterns of anthocyanin accumulation in photosynthetic calyces, leaves and stems and throughout the reproductive season, and their relationship with flower abortion, florivory and plant mortality due to drought. In addition, the flavonoid production and the photoinhibitory response were measured in a shading experiment.  The whole plant becomes red at the end of the flowering and remains red until fruiting and senescence. Calyces were redder on the side with more sun exposition. Aborted flowers showed redder calyces than those of fruiting flowers. No effect of plant redness on florivory or plant mortality was found. The shading experiment showed a positive relationship between anthocyanin accumulation and intensity of solar radiation, but plants growing in absence of UV showed similar redness than full sunlight plants. Plants growing in natural shade lack anthocyanins but produced the same amount of non-anthocyanin flavonoids.

We investigated the flowering phenology of male and female adults, and female reproductive output, in 10 patches with various sex ratios, of the dioecious shrub Ilex leucoclada (Maxim.) Makino over three consecutive years in an old-growth beech forest. Sexual dimorphism was observed in flowering amplitude, but not in other traits examined, including flowering onset date, duration, peak date, and synchrony with plants of the opposite sex in the population. Plant size had a consistent, positive effect on flowering amplitude in both sexes throughout the study period, but its effects on other factors, including the extent of fruit set, varied. Females in mixed patches showed higher fruit set than those in female patches. Furthermore, although the reproductive output of the female I. leucoclada plants is likely to be affected by flowering phenological traits in the mixed patches, the importance of these factor is probably modulated by other variables, including precipitation (which had a major effect on male flowering patterns) and the spatial distribution of the males.},

Female ﬂowers produced signiﬁcantly more nectar sugar than did males, mainly because of a higher concentration of sugars in nectar (440 vs. 325 mg/mL). The temporal pattern of secretion was similar in the two sexes, and both nectars were sucrose rich. Sugar composition did not vary during anthesis.

We examined nectar traits of males and females in paternal half-sibling families of dioecious Silene latifolia, a species with sexually dimorphic flower production that is pollinated by nectar-seeking moths. Nectar volume and total sugar content peaked 3 days after flower opening in males and 4 days after flower opening in females. Flowers on females had greater nectar volume and total sugar than did those on males, but nectar in the latter was higher in concentration. Variation among paternal families in nectar volume and total sugar was detected only in females; selection by pollinators may have eliminated genetic variation in nectar production in males. We estimated whole-plant investment in nectar by multiplying family means by the number of reproductive units of each plant. Nectar investment per plant did not differ between males and unpollinated females, but was much lower in pollinated females because they produced fewer flowers. Based on estimated values of flower and fruit number, whole-plant nectar investment for males is expected to be higher than that for females under low to moderate levels of pollination.},

The analysis, based on a single segregating generation and the major gene plus polygene mixed inheritance model, showed that the inheritance of both traits was compatible with the presence of two pairs of major genes displaying additivity–dominance–epistasis, with additivity predominating. As the heritability of both pairs of major genes was high (initial blooming time *65\%, duration of ﬂowering *72\%), it should be possible to select for both traits in early breeding generations. A marker-trait association analysis based on sequence-related ampliﬁed polymorphism (SRAP) genotyping uncovered 10 (initial blooming time) and 12 (duration of ﬂowering) markers signiﬁcantly associated with phenotype, cumulatively explaining, respectively, 46 and 54\% of the variation.

However, few studies have demonstrated a causal link between natural variation in attractive traits and natural variation in visitation to whole plants. Here we examine the effects of flower number and size on visitation to wild radish by two taxa of pollinators over 3 years, using a combination of multiple regression and experimental reductions in both traits. We found strong, consistent evidence that increases in both flower number and size cause increased visitation by syrphid flies. The results for small bees were harder to interpret, because the multiple regression and experimental manipulation results did not agree. It is likely that increased flower size causes a weak increase in smallbee visitation, but strong relationships between flower number and small-bee visitation seen in 2 years of observational studies were not corroborated by experimental manipulation of this trait. Small bees may actually have responded to an unmeasured trait correlated with flower number, or lower small-bee abundances when the flower number manipulation was conducted may have reduced our ability to detect a causal relationship. We conclude that studies using only 1 year, one method, or measuring only one trait may not provide an adequate understanding of the effects of plant traits on pollinator attraction.},

In contrast to the extensive studies of the ecological and evolutionary consequences of nectar theft, pollen theft and its implications remain largely neglected, even though it affects plant reproduction more directly. Here we review existing studies of pollen theft and find that: (1) most pollen thieves pollinate other plant species, suggesting that theft generally arises from a mismatch between the flower and thief that precludes pollen deposition, (2) bees are the most commonly documented pollen thieves, and (3) the floral traits that typically facilitate pollen theft involve either spatial or temporal separation of sex function within flowers (herkogamy and dichogamy, respectively). Given that herkogamy and dichogamy occur commonly and that bees are globally the most important floral visitors, pollen theft is likely a greatly underappreciated component of floral ecology and influence on floral evolution. We identify the mechanisms by which pollen theft can affect plant fitness, and review the evidence for theft-induced ecological effects, including pollen limitation. We then explore the consequences of pollen theft for the evolution of floral traits and sexual systems, and conclude by identifying key directions for future research.},

	abstract = {Gynodioecious species are deﬁned by the co-occurrence of two clearly separated categories of plants: females and hermaphrodites. The hermaphroditic category may, however, not be homogeneous, as male ﬁtness may vary among hermaphrodites as a result of many biological factors. In this study, we analysed estimates of pollen quantity and viability in the gynodioecious Beta vulgaris ssp. maritima, comparing hermaphrodites bearing a male-fertile cytotype and hermaphrodites bearing cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) genes, which are counteracted by nuclear restoration factors. We show that: (i) pollen quantity continuously varies among restored hermaphrodites, suggesting a complex genetic determination of nuclear restoration; (ii) pollen viability was lower in restored (CMS) hermaphrodites than in non-CMS hermaphrodites, probably because of incomplete restoration in some of these plants; and (iii) pollen quantity and viability also varied among hermaphrodites with male-fertile cytotypes, possibly a result of a silent cost of restoration. Finally, we discuss the consequences of these results for pollen ﬂow and the dynamics of gynodioecy.},

	abstract = {We conducted field experiments to determine how a naturally occurring petal-color polymorphism influences mating patterns in wild radish iRaphanus raphanistrum). The polymorphism is controlled at a single genetic locus, with white petal color being completely dominant to yellow. In experimental populations with equal numbers ofyellow- and white-flowered homozygous individuals, insect visitors strongly discriminated against white flowers. Pieris rapae, the most frequent pollinator, was almost 50\% more likely to visit yellow than white flowers. Maternal fecundity did not differ between the morphs and was not significantly influenced by a plant's compatibility with potential donors, suggesting that seed production was not limited by receipt of compatible pollen. In contrast, the yellow-flowered morph sired approximately 75\% of all seeds produced during the study. This paternity proportion was consistently greater than that expected on the basis ofpost pollination compatibility measures and was indistinguishable from that expected on the basis of pollinator-visitation frequency. We conclude that the male-fitness advantage ofthe yellow morph resulted from enhanced pollen export due to the greater attractiveness of its flowers to insect pollinators. With color morphs evenly distributed in experimental arrays, insects did not move assortatively on the basis of petal color, and we found no evidence for assortative pollen flow due to the floral polymorphism. Once postpollination compatibility relationships within populations were taken into account, paternal success of yellow donors did not differ between yellow- and white-flowered maternal plants.},

	abstract = {Amphibians are undergoing a major decline worldwide and the steady increase in the number of threatened species in this particular taxa highlights the need for conservation genetics studies using high-quality molecular markers. The natterjack toad, Bufo (Epidalea) calamita, is a vulnerable pioneering species confined to specialized habitats in Western Europe. To provide efficient and cost-effective genetic resources for conservation biologists, we developed and characterized 22 new nuclear microsatellite markers using next-generation sequencing. We also used sequence data acquired from Sanger sequencing to develop the first mitochondrial markers for KASPar assay genotyping. Genetic polymorphism was then analyzed for 95 toads sampled from 5 populations in France. For polymorphic microsatellite loci, number of alleles and expected heterozygosity ranged from 2 to 14 and from 0.035 to 0.720, respectively. No significant departures from panmixia were observed (mean multilocus FIS = −0.015) and population differentiation was substantial (mean multilocus FST = 0.222, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001). From a set of 18 mitochondrial SNPs located in the 16S and D-loop region, we further developed a fast and cost-effective SNP genotyping method based on competitive allele-specific PCR amplification (KASPar). The combination of allelic states for these mitochondrial DNA SNP markers yielded 10 different haplotypes, ranging from 2 to 5 within populations. Populations were highly differentiated (GST = 0.407, P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001).These new genetic resources will facilitate future parentage, population genetics and phylogeographical studies and will be useful for both evolutionary and conservation concerns, especially for the set-up of management strategies and the definition of distinct evolutionary significant units.},

In angiosperms, heteromorphic sex chromosomes are found in at least 19 species from 4 families, while homomorphic sex chromosomes occur in 20 species from 13 families. The prevalence of the XY system found in 44 out of 48 species may reﬂect the predominance of the evolutionary pathway from gynodioecy towards dioecy. All dioecious species have the potential to evolve sex chromosomes, and reversions back from dioecy to various forms of monoecy, gynodioecy, or androdioecy have also occurred.

Experimental results presented here indicate that selection through male function favors smaller display sizes in Ipomoea purpurea. In small arrays, plant display size was manipulated experimentally, and female selﬁng rate, male outcross success, and total male ﬁtness were estimated using genetic markers and likelihood and regression analyses. As would be expected if larger displays experience greater geitonogamy, selﬁng rate increased with display size. However, the perﬂower amount of pollen exported to other plants decreased with display size. The magnitude of this effect is more than sufﬁcient to offset the increase in selﬁng rate, resulting in reduced per-ﬂower total male ﬁtness with increasing display size. The low values of inbreeding depression previously reported for this species would enhance this effect.},

Male and female reproductive success were highly correlated, with {\textbackslash}textgreater90\% of plants that received a pollinium also dispersing one. Despite very low visitation rates, the chance of a removed pollinium fertilizing another ovary was 36\% and 51\%, respectively, in the two populations. There was no evidence for selection acting differently, either through the two sexual functions or in the two populations. In contrast, the strength of directional selection on several traits differed among microhabitats within each population. Univariate and multivariate regressions indicated statistically significant directional selection acting on flower-opening date through male, female, and total (combined) pollination success in one population. For female, male, and total success in this population, we also detected correlational selection acting on opening date and flower height. There was also negative correlational selection acting on flower height and labellum length through female success. Microhabitats within the populations had a larger effect on both female and male success than did floral traits. In particular, the presence of ericaceous shrubs and an open canopy appeared to be closely linked with higher pollination rates.},

	abstract = {A previous study of Campanula punctata pollinated by Bombus diversus showed greater male reproductive success in plants with wider corollas when male reproductive success was measured by paternity analysis. Pollen removal alone was not a good measure of male reproductive success. The aim of the current study is to elucidate the mechanism underlying the selection on corolla width in C. punctata. Multiple regression analysis of male reproductive success in experimental populations revealed that the advantage of a wide corolla to the male is independent of the corolla width of pollen recipients, indicating that the position of pollen deposited on Bombus may not be an important factor for selection. However, the number of pollen grains that fell on the petal or off the flower and were lost at the first visit of Bombus (pollen fall) decreased with increasing corolla width, so that most pollen grains removed from a wide flower were deposited onto the pollinator. In a narrow flower, a greater proportion of the pollen removed was wasted through pollen fall. Pollen removal does not reflect male reproductive success, at least in part because of the loss of pollen in some flowers through pollen fall. The positive relationship between wider corollas and reduced loss of pollen through pollen fall is likely to lead to greater male reproductive success of wider flowers under repeated visits of pollinators. Decreased pollen fall, probably due to more gentle contact between pollen and bees in flowers with wider corollas, may be one of the mechanisms underlying the selection on corolla width of C. punctata.},

	abstract = {Sexual dimorphism is one of the most widespread and recognizable patterns of phenotypic variation in the biotic world. Sexual dimorphism in ﬂoral display is striking in the dioecious plant Silene latifolia, with males making many, small ﬂowers compared to females. We investigated this dimorphism via artiﬁcial selection on two populations to determine whether genetic variation exists within populations for ﬂower size and the extent of the between-sex correlation, whether a ﬂower size and number trade-off exists within each sex, and whether pollen and ovule production vary with ﬂower size. We selected for decreased ﬂower size (calyx width) in females and increased ﬂower size in males and measured the response to selection in size and correlated responses in ﬂower dry mass, ﬂower number, and pollen or ovule number per ﬂower. Four bouts of selection in each of two selection programs were performed, for a total of three selection lines to decrease size, three to increase it, and two control lines. Flower size always signiﬁcantly responded to selection and we always found a signiﬁcant correlated response in the sex not under selection. Selection decreased but did not eliminate the sexual dimorphism in ﬂower dry mass and number. A negative relationship between ﬂower size and number within each sex was revealed. Whereas ovule number showed a signiﬁcant correlated response to selection on ﬂower size, pollen number did not. Our results indicate that although substantial additive genetic variation for ﬂower size exists, the high between-sex genetic correlation would likely constrain ﬂower size from becoming more sexually dimorphic. Furthermore, ﬂoral display within each sex is constrained by a ﬂower size and number trade-off. Given this trade-off and lack of variation in pollen production with ﬂower size, we suggest that sexual dimorphism evolved via sexual selection to increase ﬂower number in males but not females.},

These prerequisites have only rarely been examined in natural populations. For Mimulus guttatus, we found by using the Riska-method that corolla width, anther length, ovary length and number of red dots on the corolla were heritable in a natural population. Seed production (maternal ﬁtness) was directly positively affected by corolla width and anther size, and indirectly so by ovary length and number of red dots on the corolla. The siring success (paternal ﬁtness), as estimated from allozyme data, was directly negatively affected by anther–stigma separation, and indirectly so by the corolla length–width ratio. Genetic correlations, estimated with the Lynch-method, were positive between ﬂoral size measures. We predict that larger ﬂowers with larger reproductive organs, which generally favour outcrossing, will evolve in this natural population of M. guttatus.},

We determined male-speciﬁc ﬁtness consequences of ﬂoral phenotype in andromonoecious Solanum carolinense, examined the relationship between male and female reproductive success within plants, and evaluated the distribution of functional gender among plants. A maximum likelihood-based paternity analysis, based on multilocus allozyme phenotypes of parents and offspring from four experimental plots, was used to determine male reproductive success and its relationship to ﬂoral phenotype. Male success was enhanced by an increase in the proportion of male ﬂowers produced but not by an increase in total ﬂower number, even though all ﬂowers contain male parts. Larger ﬂower size increased male success in only one plot. Male and female reproductive success were negatively correlated, and plants varied in functional gender from completely female to completely male. This gender specialization may occur because hermaphroditic and male ﬂowers differ in their ability to contribute to male and female success. Although sex allocation theory predicts a positive relationship between the size or number of plant parts and reproductive success, this study indicates that aspects of ﬂoral morphology that affect gender specialization should also be considered.},

We measured selection on a variety of wild radish floral traits using lifetime male fitness measures derived from genetic paternity analysis. These male fitness estimates were then combined with estimates of lifetime female fitness of the same plants to produce measurements of selection based on lifetime total fitness. Contrary to the prediction above, there was no strong evidence for selection on floral morphology through male fitness differences in any of the three years of the study, but there was strong selection for increased flower size through female fitness differences in one year. The main determinant of both male and female fitness in all years was flower number; this lead to moderately positive correlations between male and female fitness in all three years.},

First, the definition of sexual selection has received renewed interest in light of increasing research effort into when and how it operates in females. Second, how best to measure sexual selection is an ongoing subject of debate; in practice, recognition that the appropriate measures depend on the focus of the specific study, and that multiple measures should be employed wherever possible, seems to provide the most informative approach. The wide scope of recent empirical work in these and related areas, with the application of new techniques and approaches, reflects that the field of sexual selection is being constantly expanded and enriched [Current Zoology 59 (4): 558–563, 2013].},

We trained captive hummingbirds to feed from flowers of this species in a flight cage, and explored the effects of different degrees of floral variability on carryover of fluorescent dyes that act as pollen mimics. We found that the slopes of linear dye carryover functions generally became more shallow as floral variability increased; this led to substantially longer carryover in the treatment with greatest variability. On the other hand, total amounts of dye transferred did not appear to be sensitive to the degree of variability. Floral variability may have a subtle but important effect on plant fitness by influencing the distance of pollen transfer.},

Yet fundamental differences in color vision between humans and other animals call this approach into question. Here we use techniques for objectively assessing color patterns that avoid reliance on species-speciﬁc (e.g., human) perception. Reﬂectance spectra are the invariant features that we expect the animal’s color cognition to have evolved to extract. We performed multivariate analyses on principal components derived from 12,600 reﬂectance spectra (300–720 nm) sampled in a stratiﬁed random design from different body regions of male and female starlings in breeding plumage. Starlings possess spatially complex plumage patterns and extensive areas of iridescence. Our study revealed previously unnoticed sex differences in plumage coloration and the nature of iridescent and noniridescent sex differences. Sex differences occurred in some body regions but not others, were more pronounced at some wavelengths (both ultraviolet and human visible), and involved differences in mean reﬂectance and spectral shape. Discriminant analysis based on principal components were sufﬁcient to sex correctly 100\% of our sample. If hidden sexual dichromatism is widespread, then it has important implications for classiﬁcations of animals as mono- or dimorphic and for taxonomic and conservation purposes.},

The Darwin-Bateman paradigm predicts that anisogamy imposes stronger sexual selection on males, which, in turn, drives the evolution of conventional sex roles in terms of female-biased parental care and male-biased sexual dimorphism. Although this paradigm forms the cornerstone of modern sexual selection theory, it still remains untested across the animal tree of life. This lack of evidence has promoted the rise of alternative hypotheses arguing that sex differences are entirely driven by environmental factors or chance. We demonstrate that, across the animal kingdom, sexual selection, as captured by standard Bateman metrics, is indeed stronger in males than in females and that it is evolutionarily tied to sex biases in parental care and sexual dimorphism. Our findings provide the first comprehensive evidence that Darwin’s concept of conventional sex roles is accurate and refute recent criticism of sexual selection theory.},

	abstract = {Background In plants, reproductive success is largely determined by the composition of pollen (i.e., selfpollen and outcross-pollen from near and distant pollen-donors) transported as a result of pollinator foraging behavior (e.g., pollen carryover). However, little evidence is available on how and to what extent the pollen carryover affects the pollen-donor composition and on which insect taxa are effective outcross-pollen transporters under field conditions. In this study, we explored roles of foraging behavior of insect pollinators on pollen-donor composition and subsequent reproductive success in a woody plant. Methods We performed paternity analyses based on microsatellite genotyping of individual pollen grains found on diurnal pollinators (i.e., bumblebee, small bee, fly, small beetle, and honeybee) visiting Castanea crenata trees. Results The outcross-pollen rate was highest in bumblebees (66\%), followed by small bees (35\%), flies (31\%), and small beetles (18\%). The effective number of pollen donors, representing pollen carryover, was greater in bumblebees (9.71) than in flies (3.40), small bees (3.32), and small beetles (3.06). The high percentages of pollen from outside the plot on bumblebees (65.4\%) and flies (71.2\%) compared to small bees (35.3\%) and small beetles (13.5\%) demonstrated their longer pollen dispersal distances. Conclusions All of the diurnal insects carried outcross-pollen grains for long distances via pollen carryover. This fact suggests that a wide range of insect taxa are potential outcross-pollen transporters for the self-incompatible C. crenata.},

We investigated differences in the intensity of sexual selection, as estimated using three standard indices of sexual selection—the standardized selection gradient (b ), the opportunity of selection (I ), and the Bateman gradient (bss)—calculated for different pools of individuals and different ﬁtness proxies. We show that results based on estimates of I were the opposite of those derived from the other indices, whereas results based on estimates of b were consistent with predictions derived from knowledge about the species’ mating system. In addition, our estimates of the strength and direction of sexual selection depended on both the ﬁtness proxy used and the pool of individuals included in the analysis. These observations demonstrate inconsistencies in distinct measures of sexual selection and underscore the need for caution when comparing studies and species.},

However, no empirical study on P:O ratios has directly and quantitatively measured pollen transfer efﬁciency (PE). Here, we use a PE index, deﬁned as the proportion of pollen grains removed from anthers that are subsequently deposited on conspeciﬁc stigmas, as a direct and quantitative measure of PE. We investigated P:O ratios, pollen removal and pollen deposition in 26 plant species in an alpine meadow, over three consecutive years. Our community survey showed that nearly 5\% of removed pollen was successfully deposited on conspeciﬁc stigmas. The PE index ranged from 0.01\% up to 78.56\% among species, and correlated negatively with the P:O ratio across years. This correlation was not changed by controlling for phylogenetic relationships among species, suggesting that the interspeciﬁc variation in P:O ratios can be attributed to the probability of pollen grains reaching a stigma. The results indicate that the pollination efﬁciency hypothesis can help to explain interspeciﬁc variation in P:O ratios.},

	abstract = {In an archipelago in northern Sweden, populations of the perennial, dioecious, and insect-pollinated herb Silene dioica are commonly infected by the sterilising anther-smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum. The results from transplantation and inoculation experiments in this study show that variation between populations in the incidence of disease may partly be due to variation in resistance among populations. In the transplantation experiment in which plants were naturally exposed to the fungus, disease levels varied greatly among transplants from three healthy populations when transplanted to three diseased populations in the archipelago. Clear genotypic differences in susceptibility among 25 replicated genotypes of the host plants were found when inoculated manually with two different isolates. Susceptibility varied between 0-90\%, but the two isolates used did not differ in inoculation success. The results also suggest a geographical structuring in resistance of the host and virulence of the fungus. First, disease levels among experimental plants from two of the disease-free populations of S. dioica (originating from inner and outer archipelago, respectively), were high when transplanted to a diseased population nearby, but low when transplanted far away. Second, regardless of origin, plants from all healthy populations became diseased in the diseased experimental populations located in the middle part of the archipelago. Due to isostatic land upheaval in the studied archipelago, there is a vertical age-axis within islands such that the highest point on an island is the oldest. Since this may affect the demography of the host, disease spread, and the dynamics of disease, spatial patterns in adult and seedling densities, and disease and spore deposition along the age-axis were studied within three diseased populations. A low incidence of disease was found in the young, low and old, high parts of the populations and a high incidence in the vertical, middle parts of the populations. The higher disease incidence in the middle part compared with the lower part of the population may reflect less disturbance and an increased probability of disease with age.},

In particular, we explain why the most widespread approach to standardizing selection, which measures selection differentials in units of a trait’s phenotypic standard deviation, is less appropriate for characterizing the strengths of natural selection in wild populations. In contrast, an alternative standardization approach that uses a trait’s phenotypic mean in addition to its standard deviation results in another dimensionless measure: the mean-standardized selection gradient. This measure offers some key benefits over alternative approaches, such as ease of interpretation, independence of a trait’s variance, and the natural interplay of ecological and evolutionary dynamics, and yet it remains rarely used by evolutionary biologists. We explain how the more routine application of this measure will facilitate comparisons of selection strengths in the wild among traits, populations, and species.},

	abstract = {The world in color presents a dazzling dimension of phenotypic variation. Biological interest in this variation has burgeoned, due to both increased means for quantifying spectral information and heightened appreciation for how animals view the world differently than humans. Effective study of color traits is challenged by how to best quantify visual perception in nonhuman species. This requires consideration of at least visual physiology but ultimately also the neural processes underlying perception. Our knowledge of color perception is founded largely on the principles gained from human psychophysics that have proven generalizable based on comparative studies in select animal models. Appreciation of these principles, their empirical foundation, and the reasonable limits to their applicability is crucial to reaching informed conclusions in color research. In this article, we seek a common intellectual basis for the study of color in nature. We ﬁrst discuss the key perceptual principles, namely, retinal photoreception, sensory channels, opponent processing, color constancy, and receptor noise. We then draw on this basis to inform an analytical framework driven by the research question in relation to identiﬁable viewers and visual tasks of interest. Consideration of the limits to perceptual inference guides two primary decisions: ﬁrst, whether a sensory-based approach is necessary and justiﬁed and, second, whether the visual task refers to perceptual distance or discriminability. We outline informed approaches in each situation and discuss key challenges for future progress, focusing particularly on how animals perceive color. Given that animal behavior serves as both the basic unit of psychophysics and the ultimate driver of color ecology/evolution, behavioral data are critical to reconciling knowledge across the schools of color research.},

	abstract = {Darwin was the first to recognize that sexual selection is a strong evolutionary force. Exaggerated traits allow same-sex individuals to compete over access to mates and provide a mechanism by which mates are selected. It is relatively easy to appreciate how inter- and intrasexual selection work in organisms with the sensory capabilities to perceive physical or behavioural traits that signal mate quality or mate compatibility, and to assess the relative quality of competitors. It is therefore not surprising that most studies of sexual selection have focused on animals with separate sexes and obvious adaptations that function in the context of reproductive competition. Yet, many sexual organisms are both male and female at the same time, often lack sexual dimorphism and never come into direct contact at mating. How does sexual selection act in such species, and what can we learn from them? Here, we address these questions by exploring the potential for sexual selection in simultaneous hermaphrodites, sperm- and broadcast spawners, plants and fungi. Our review reveals a range of mechanisms of sexual selection, operating primarily after gametes have been released, which are common in many of these groups and also quite possibly in more familiar (internally fertilizing and sexually dimorphic) organisms.

	abstract = {Abstract Background Pollen transfer via animals is necessary for reproduction by {\textbackslash}textasciitilde80 \% of flowering plants, and most of these plants live in multispecies communities where they can share pollinators. While diffuse plant–pollinator interactions are increasingly recognized as the rule rather than the exception, their fitness consequences cannot be deduced from flower visitation alone, so other proxies, functionally closer to seed production and amenable for use in a broad variety of diverse communities, are necessary. Scope We conceptually summarize how the study of pollen on stigmas of spent flowers can reflect key drivers and functional aspects of the plant–pollinator interaction (e.g. competition, facilitation or commensalism). We critically evaluate how variable visitation rates and other factors (pollinator pool and floral avoidance) can give rise to different relationships between heterospecific pollen and (1) conspecific pollen on the stigma and (2) conspecific tubes/grain in the style, revealing the complexity of potential interpretations. We advise on best practices for using these proxies, noting the assumptions and caveats involved in their use, and explicate what additional data are required to verify interpretation of given patterns. Conclusions We conclude that characterizing pollen on stigmas of spent flowers provides an attainable indirect measure of pollination interactions, but given the complex processes of pollen transfer that generate patterns of conspecific–heterospecific pollen on stigmas these cannot alone determine whether competition or facilitation are the underlying drivers. Thus, functional tests are also needed to validate these hypotheses.},

	abstract = {Sexual reproduction is vital to ensure variation and perpetuation in organisms. In flowering plants, the reproductive process is accomplished in four major phases. The first phase encompasses the development and organization of flowers, the second ensures pollination, the third includes events leading to fertilization and seed formation and the fourth is defined by dispersal of seeds and their recruitment in populations. Plants optimize reproductive success through interaction between these components of reproductive system and ecological factors. Longevity, vitality and sterility of sexual systems have been well understood in wild and crop species and studies on these aspects have unravelled interesting patterns in angiosperms. However, there is paucity of information on certain aspects such as how plant species modify their reproductive functions in varied habitats and how sexual systems respond to evolutionary pathways, and environmental cues. Reproductive ecological studies are currently trying to answer these questions, as reproductive processes operate in continuum with environmental variables and show specific responses and patterns. These studies also help in understanding the trade-offs and constraints that the angiosperms are always confronted with. The present chapter highlights some of the crucial aspects of reproduction covering phenology, floral biology, pollination ecology, breeding strategies and recruitment pattern. Elucidation of these processes is of immense importance in the management of forest ecosystems, recovery of threatened plant species and sustenance of yield in crops.},

	abstract = {Dioecy, the co-existence of separate male and female individuals in a population, is a rare but phylogenetically widespread sexual system in ﬂowering plants. While research has concentrated on why and how dioecy evolves from hermaphroditism, the question of why dioecy is rare, despite repeated transitions to it, has received much less attention. Previous phylogenetic and theoretical studies have suggested that dioecy might be an evolutionary dead end. However, recent research indicates that the phylogenetic support for this hypothesis is attributable to a methodological bias, and that there is no evidence for reduced diversiﬁcation in dioecious angiosperms. The relative rarity of dioecy thus remains a puzzle. Here, we review evidence for the hypothesis that dioecy might be rare not because it is an evolutionary dead end, but rather because it easily reverts to hermaphroditism. We review what is known about transitions between hermaphroditism and dioecy, and conclude that there is an important need to consider more widely the possibility of transitions away from dioecy, both from an empirical and a theoretical point of view, and by combining tools from molecular evolution and insights from ecology.},

	abstract = {The analysis of sexual selection classically relies on the regression of individual phenotypes against the marginal sums of a males × females matrix of pairwise reproductive success, assessed by genetic parentage analysis. When the matrix is binarized, the marginal sums give the individual mating success. Because such analysis treats male and female mating/reproductive success independently, it ignores that the success of a male × female sexual interaction can be attributable to the phenotype of both individuals. Also, because it is based on genetic data only, it is oblivious to unproductive matings, which may be documented by behavioral observations. To solve these problems, we propose a statistical approach which combines matrices of offspring numbers and behavioral observations. It models reproduction on each mating occasion of a mating season as three stochastic and interdependent pairwise processes, each potentially affected by the phenotype of both individuals and by random individual effect: visit of a female by a male, concomitant gamete emission, and offspring production. Applied to data from a mating experiment on brown trout, the model yielded different results from the classical regression analysis, with only a negative effect of female body size on the probability of visit and gamete release, while the classical approach based on regression found a positive effect of male size on the number of both visits and offspring, and no effect of female size. Because the general structure of the model can be adapted to other partitioning schemes of the reproductive process, it can be used for a variety of biological systems where behavioral and genetic data are available.},

	abstract = {Females frequently mate with several males, whose sperm then compete to fertilize available ova. Sperm competition represents a potent selective force that is expected to shape male expenditure on the ejaculate. Here, we review empirical data that illustrate the evolutionary consequences of sperm competition. Sperm competition favors the evolution of increased testes size and sperm production. In some species, males appear capable of adjusting the number of sperm ejaculated, depending on the perceived levels of sperm competition. Selection is also expected to act on sperm form and function, although the evidence for this remains equivocal. Comparative studies suggest that sperm length and swimming speed may increase in response to selection from sperm competition. However, the mechanisms driving this pattern remain unclear. Evidence that sperm length influences sperm swimming speed is mixed and fertilization trials performed across a broad range of species demonstrate inconsistent relationships between sperm form and function. This ambiguity may in part reflect the important role that seminal fluid proteins (sfps) play in affecting sperm function. There is good evidence that sfps are subject to selection from sperm competition, and recent work is pointing to an ability of males to adjust their seminal fluid chemistry in response to sperm competition from rival males. We argue that future research must consider sperm and seminal fluid components of the ejaculate as a functional unity. Research at the genomic level will identify the genes that ultimately control male fertility.},

	abstract = {The past half century has seen the development of the field of post-ejaculatory sexual selection, the sequel to sexual selection for mate-acquisition (pre-ejaculatory) described by Darwin. In richness and diversity of adaptations, post-ejaculatory selection rivals that of pre-ejaculatory sexual selection. Anisogamy—and hence two sexes—likely arose by primeval gamete competition, and sperm competition remains a major force maintaining high sperm numbers. The post-ejaculatory equivalent of male–male competition for matings, sperm competition was an intense ancestral form of sexual selection, typically weakening as mobility and internal fertilization developed in many taxa, when some expenditure became diverted into pre-ejaculatory competition. Sperm competition theory has been relatively successful in explaining variation in relative testes size and sperm numbers per ejaculate and is becoming more successful in explaining variation in sperm phenotype. Sperm competition has generated many other male adaptations such as seminal fluid proteins that variously modify female reproduction towards male interests, and copulatory plugs, prolonged copulations and post-ejaculatory guarding behaviour that reduce female remating probability, many of which result in sexual conflict. This short survey of conceptual developments is intended as a broad overview, mainly as a primer for new researchers. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Fifty years of sperm competition'.},

Since the publication of his seminal paper, sperm competition has developed into a large field of research, and many aspects are still being discovered. One of the relatively poorly understood aspects is the importance of selection and competition among sperm within the ejaculate of a male. The sheer number of sperm present in a male's ejaculate suggests that the competition among sibling sperm produced by the same male may be intense. In this review, we summarize Parker's theoretical models generating predictions about the evolution of sperm traits under the control of the haploid gamete as opposed to the diploid male. We review the existing evidence of within-ejaculate competition from a wide range of fields and taxa. We also discuss the conceptual and practical hurdles we have been facing to study within-ejaculate sperm competition, and how novel technologies may help in addressing some of the currently open questions.

Why have males in many animals evolved more conspicuous ornaments, signals, and weapons than females? How can such traits evolve although they may reduce male survival? Such questions prompted Darwin's perhaps most scientifically controversial idea–the theory of sexual selection. It still challenges researchers today as they try to understand how competition for mates can favor the variety of sex-dimorphic traits. Reviewing theoretical and empirical work in this very active field, Malte Andersson, a leading contributor himself, provides a major up-to-date synthesis of sexual selection. The author describes the theory and its recent development; examines models, methods, and empirical tests; and identifies many unsolved problems. Among the topics discussed are the selection and evolution of mating preferences; relations between sexual selection and speciation; constraints on sexual selection; and sex differences in signals, body size, and weapons. The rapidly growing study of sexual selection in plants is also reviewed. This volume will interest students, teachers, and researchers in behavioral ecology and evolutionary biology.},

A comparative understanding of how this limited resource is partitioned among primary (male and female structures) and secondary (petals and sepals) sexual organs on hermaphrodite species can shed light on general evolutionary processes behind flower evolution. Here, we use allometries relating different flower biomass components across species to test the existence of broad allocation patterns across the angiosperms. Based on a global dataset with flower biomass spanning five orders of magnitude, we show that heavier angiosperm flowers tend to be male-biased and invest strongly in petals to promote pollen export, while lighter flowers tend to be female-biased and invest more in sepals to insure their own seed set. This result demonstrates that larger flowers are not simple carbon copies of small ones, indicating that sexual selection via male–male competition is an important driver of flower biomass evolution and sex allocation strategies across angiosperms.},

But the attention of biologists turned to the more general concept of natural selection, in which sexual selection plays a complex role that has been little understood. This volume significantly broadens the scope of modern evolutionary biology by looking at this important and long neglected concept of great importance. In this book, which is the first full discussion of sexual selection since 1871, leading biologists bring modern genetic theory and behavior observation to bear on the subject. The distinguished authors consider many aspects of sexual selection in many species, including man, within the context of contemporary evolutionary theory and research. The result is a remarkably original and well-rounded view of the whole concept that will be invaluable especially to students of evolution and human sexual behavior. The lucid authority of the contributors and the importance of the topic will interest all who share in man\&\#39;s perennial fascination with his own history. The book will be of central importance to a wide variety of professionals, including biologists, anthropologists, and geneticists. It will be an invaluable supplementary text for courses in vertebrate biology, theory of evolution, genetics, and physical anthropology. It is especially important with the emergence of alternative explanations of human development, under the rubric of creationism and doctrines of intelligent design. Bernard G. Campbell is professor of anthropology at the University of California, Los Angeles. Born in Weybridge, England, he received his Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1957, and has been a lecturer in anthropology at Cambridge and Harvard Universities.

	abstract = {Sexual reproduction and clonality in eukaryotes are mostly seen as exclusive, the latter being rather exceptional. This view might be biased by focusing almost exclusively on metazoans. We analyze and discuss reproduction in the context of extant eukaryotic diversity, paying special attention to protists. We present results of phylogenetically extended searches for homologs of two proteins functioning in cell and nuclear fusion, respectively (HAP2 and GEX1), providing indirect evidence for these processes in several eukaryotic lineages where sex has not been observed yet. We argue that ( i ) the debate on the relative significance of sex and clonality in eukaryotes is confounded by not appropriately distinguishing multicellular and unicellular organisms; ( ii ) eukaryotic sex is extremely widespread and already present in the last eukaryotic common ancestor; and ( iii ) the general mode of existence of eukaryotes is best described by clonally propagating cell lines with episodic sex triggered by external or internal clues. However, important questions concern the relative longevity of true clonal species (i.e., species not able to return to sexual procreation anymore). Long-lived clonal species seem strikingly rare. We analyze their properties in the light of meiotic sex development from existing prokaryotic repair mechanisms. Based on these considerations, we speculate that eukaryotic sex likely developed as a cellular survival strategy, possibly in the context of internal reactive oxygen species stress generated by a (proto) mitochondrion. Thus, in the context of the symbiogenic model of eukaryotic origin, sex might directly result from the very evolutionary mode by which eukaryotic cells arose.},

	abstract = {The idea that sex functions to provide variation for natural selection to act upon was ﬁrst advocated by August Weismann and it has dominated much discussion on the evolution of sex and recombination since then. The goal of this paper is to further extend this hypothesis and to assess its place in a larger body of theory on the evolution of sex and recombination. A simple generic model is developed to show how ﬁtness variation and covariation interact with selection for recombination and illustrate some important implications of the hypothesis: (1) the advantage of sex and recombination can accrue both to reproductively isolated populations and to modiﬁers segregating within populations, but the former will be much larger than the latter; (2) forces of degradation that are correlated across loci within an individual can reduce or reverse selection for increased recombination; and (3) crossing-over (which can occur at different places in different meioses) will create more variability than having multiple chromosomes and so will have more inﬂuence on the efﬁcacy of selection. Several long-term selection experiments support Weismann’s hypothesis, including those showing a greater response to selection in populations with higher rates of recombination and higher rates of recombination evolving as a correlated response to selection for some other character. Weismann’s hypothesis is also consistent with the sporadic distribution of obligate asexuality, which indicates that clones have a higher rate of extinction than sexuals. Weismann’s hypothesis is then discussed in light of other patterns in the distribution of sexuality versus asexuality. To account for variation in the frequency of obligate asexuality in different taxa, a simple model is developed in which this frequency is a function of three parameters: the rate of clonal origin, the initial ﬁtness of clones when they arise, and the rate at which that ﬁtness declines over time. Variation in all three parameters is likely to be important in explaining the distribution of obligate asexuality. Facultative asexuality also exists, and for this to be stable it seems there must be ecological differences between the sexual and asexual propagules as well as genetic differences. Finally, the timing of sex in cyclical parthenogens is most likely set to minimize the opportunity costs of sex. None of these patterns contradict Weismann’s hypothesis, but they do show that many additional principles unrelated to the function of sex are required to fully explain its distribution. Weismann’s hypothesis is also consistent with what we know about the mechanics and molecular genetics of recombination, in particular the tendency for chromatids to recombine with a homolog rather than a sister chromatid at meiosis, which is opposite to what they do during mitosis. However, molecular genetic studies have shown that cis-acting sites at which recombination is initiated are lost by gene conversion as a result, a factor that can be expected to affect many ﬁne details in the evolution of recombination. In summary, although Weismann’s hypothesis must be considered the leading candidate for the function of sex and recombination, nevertheless, many additional principles are needed to fully account for their evolution.},

Only when the pollen grains in the stigma exceed the critical number, they inactivate the inhibitor by collectively raising the stigmatic pH and thus overcoming the inhibition. The adaptive significance of such pre-fertilization mechanism for the female in inciting mate competition among the pollen grains is discussed. The evolution of en masse pollen grain dispersal units is explained as a sexual selection strategy by males in response to such stigmatic inhibition by females.},

With insect pollination, a surplus of male gametophytes in the form of pollen grains may be deposited on the stigma of a pistil and this provides the potential for gametophytic competition and selection. In all plants examined from two Talinum mengesii populations, pollen germination was delayed for up to two hours after pollination. In plants of two other populations pollen germination was not delayed or the time of germination varied. Reciprocal pollinations between plants with and without the delay trait and pollinations at different times during anthesis revealed that the timing of pollen germination was regulated by the maternal parent. Theoretically, the effect of the delay trait would be to promote the accumulation of pollen on the stigma and induce simultaneous germination. This would intensify intermale competition and provide a mechanism for the maternal parent to influence the paternal parentage of its offspring.},

	abstract = {Success in reproduction is subject to the successful initiation as well as successful completion of a chain of consecutive events starting from ﬂower formation and ending with viable seed production. A pivotal role in this chain is played by the stigma which is the seat of pollen recognition and initiation of pollen–pistil interaction. An interesting feature of the family Bignoniaceae is the presence of thigmosensitive stigmas which open, close and re-open in response to touch. Kigelia pinnata bears a touch sensitive stigma and is a low fruit setter in Jammu and Kashmir (India). One possible reason might be pollen limitation coupled with reported self-incompatibility. However, not much is known about the mechanism of self-incompatibility in K. pinnata or of the role of its thigmotropic stigma. Carefully designed manual pollination experiments along with critical ﬁeld observations revealed naturally deposited pollen load to be too low to cause permanent closure of stigma lobes. A strong relationship exists between the threshold pollen load on stigma, its permanent closure and fertilization. Of the various pollination treatments undertaken, fruits were formed only in open and manual cross pollinations when \$9200 pollen of legitimate type is deposited on the stigma. Thigmosensitivity further limited the opportunity for the deposition of optimum pollen loads. Although, frequented by as many as seven different visitors, an average of 8 bats per night are available for as many as 30 trees which reﬂects a baseline deﬁciency of effective pollinators. This limitation in pollen and pollinator availability affects pollination success of this species and ends up with low fruit set. Fluorescence microscopy reveals successful germination and tube growth of pollen grains of both self and cross type but fruit-set is 100 \% in cross-pollinated pistils only. Despite slower rates of ovule penetration and evidence of delayed fertilization, absolutely no fruit initiation occurs in self-pollinated pistils. This strongly points towards self incompatibility being late acting.},

Monogamous mating constrains the reproductive success of mates to be identical, thereby converting prior conf licts between mates into opportunities for mutualism. Random mate assignment removes the opportunity for females to choose beneficial qualities in their mate. The mating treatments were maintained for 47 generations, and evolution was allowed to proceed naturally within the parameters of the design. In the monogamous populations, males evolved to be less harmful to their mates, and females evolved to be less resistant to male-induced harm. The monogamous populations also evolved a greater net reproductive rate than their promiscuous controls.

	abstract = {Floral displays, influencing attractiveness to insects, increase the number of pollinator visits and the efficiency of each visit in terms of pollen exchange and thus affect the plant reproductive success. Here, we conducted an in situ manipulation experiment to investigate whether the floral modifications affect reproductive success in natural orchid populations of Serapias lingua and Serapias vomeracea. We estimated male and female reproductive success of three treatment groups, disassembly of floral tube, cutting of lip, and painting of the callus surface, in terms of pollinaria removed/deposited and fruit production. Results revealed that phenotypic modification had opposite effects on reproductive success of two examine species. Indeed, reproductive success was significantly increased by the detached of the petals and sepals, and decreased, due to callus painting and lip removal, in S. lingua. On the contrary, unmanipulated plants of S. vomeracea showed significantly higher value of pollinaria removed and deposited and fruit set than manipulated ones. The differences between S. lingua and S. vomeracea agree to the different pollination strategy of examined species. S. vomeracea shows shelter imitation strategy, and thus, the disassembly of tunnel-­like corolla does not allow the insects to use the flower as a refuge, while S. lingua is a sexually deceptive orchid and therefore the opening of the flower made more visible callus (visible at a greater distance) increasing the pollinators attraction. This study provides evidence that pollinators were largely sensitive to the experimental modification of the flower phenotype, which is consistent with the presence of significant selection on individual floral characters. Our experimental investigations of the effects of variation in display on pollinator visitation provide insights into the evolution of floral morphology in orchid with shelter imitation strategy.},

	abstract = {Although the role of natural selection in the evolution of floral traits has been of great interest to biologists since Darwin, studies of selection on floral traits through differences in lifetime fitness have been rare. We measured selection acting on flower number, flower size, stigma exsertion, and ovule number per flower using field data on lifetime female fitness (seed production) in wild radish, Raphanus raphanistrum. The patterns of selection were reasonably consistent across three field seasons, with strong directional selection for increased flower production in all three years, weaker selection for increased ovule number per flower in two years, and selection for increased flower size in one year. The causes of the selection were investigated using path analysis combined with multiplicative fitness components. Increased flower production increased fruit production directly, and increased numbers of ovules per flower increased the number of seeds per fruit in all three years; pollinator visitation did not influence either of these fitness components. Increased flower size was associated with increases in both the number of fruit and the number of seeds per fruit in one year, with the latter relationship being stronger. Total lifetime seed production was affected more strongly by differences in fruit production than by differences in either the number of seeds per fruit or the proportion of fertilized seeds that were viable, but all three fitness components were positively correlated with total seed production.},

However, we lack experimental studies to demonstrate that differences in traitassociated reproductive performance maintain sexual trait differences between the two closely related populations, in support for a role of sexual selection in speciation. Populations of Northern Hemisphere-distributed barn swallows Hirundo rustica are closely related, yet differ in two plumage-based traits: ventral color and length of the outermost tail feathers (streamers). Here we provide experimental evidence that manipulations of these traits result in different reproductive consequences in two subspecies of barn swallow: (H.r. erythrogaster in North America and H.r. transitiva in the East Mediterranean). Experimental results in Colorado, USA demonstrate that males with (1) darkened ventral coloration and (2) shortened streamers gained paternity between two successive reproductive bouts. In contrast, exaggeration of both traits improved reproductive performance within H.r. transitiva in Israel: males with a combination treatment of darkened ventral coloration and elongated streamers gained paternity between two successive reproductive bouts. Collectively, these experimental results fill an important gap in our understanding for how divergent sexual selection maintains phenotype differentiation in closely related populations, an important aspect of the speciation process.},

We found that different genotypes maintained a consistent proportion of inviable pollen within a genotype and over time. The number of pollen grains per ﬂower was also consistent within a plant at each date but declined over time. We studied the ability of British bumble bees (Bombus spp.) to discriminate among plants of Mimulus guttatus on the basis of pollen quality and quantity at three scales: indoors with choices of two genotypes, in outdoor plots of several genotypes that varied in pollen quality, and outdoors at a whole-patch scale where two patches of plants differed in quality.},

All methods were compared using simulated data matrices of uniform correlation structure, patterned matrices of varying correlation structure and data sets of lake morphometry, water chemistry, and benthic invertebrate abundance. The most consistent results were obtained from the broken-stick model and a combined measure using bootstrapped Xs and associated eigenvector coefficients. The traditional and bootstrapped Kaiser-Guttman approaches overestimated the number of nontrivial dimensions as did the fixed-amount-of-variance model. The scree plot consistently estimated one dimension more than the number of simulated dimensions. Bartlett's test of sphericity showed inconsistent results.

	abstract = {Sexual selection studies widely estimate several metrics, but values may be inaccurate because standard field methods for studying wild populations produce limited data (e.g., incomplete sampling, inability to observe copulations directly). We compared four selection metrics (Bateman gradient, opportunity for sexual selection, opportunity for selection, and s’max) estimated with simulated complete and simulated limited data for 15 socially monogamous songbird species with extra-pair paternity (4-54\% extra-pair offspring). Inferring copulation success from offspring parentage creates non-independence between these variables and systematically underestimates copulation success. We found that this introduces substantial bias for the Bateman gradient, opportunity for sexual selection, and s’max. Notably, 47.5\% of detected Bateman gradients were significantly positive for females, suggesting selection on females to copulate with multiple males, though the true Bateman gradient was zero. Bias generally increased with the extent of other sources of data limitations tested (nest predation, male infertility, and unsampled floater males). Incomplete offspring sampling introduced bias for all metrics except the Bateman gradient, while incomplete sampling of extra-pair sires did not introduce additional bias when sires were a random subset of breeding males. Overall, our findings demonstrate how biases due to field data limitations can strongly impact the study of sexual selection.},

Yet, despite decades of research, reaching a consensus definition of the term ‘sexual selection’ has proved difficult. Here we explore why arriving at a unifying definition of sexual selection is so hard. While some researchers have argued about whether sexual selection should be considered a form of natural selection, we concentrate on where the line between sexual selection and other forms of selection falls. We focus on identifying the ‘grey zones’ of sexual selection by illustrating cases in which application of the term ‘sexual selection’ would be considered controversial or ambiguous. We believe that clarifying why sexual selection is so difficult to define is an essential first step forward towards greater clarity, and if possible towards reaching a consensus definition. We suggest that a more nuanced perspective may be necessary, particularly one that specifies for cases of ‘sexual selection’ why the term is used or whether they fall into a grey zone.},

We investigated the role of ﬂoral odour in reproductive isolation between the two closely related species Silene latifolia and S. dioica. First, we tested whether ﬂoral odour composition and emission differed between the species. We found signiﬁcant odour differences, but contrary to expectations, both species showed a rhythmic emission of the same compounds between day and night. Second, in a ﬁeld experiment, odour of the two species was made more similar by applying phenylacetaldehyde to ﬂowers. This manipulation led to higher pollen-analogue transfer between species, revealing that ﬂoral odour differences are important for maintaining reproductive isolation. We conclude that differences in single key compounds can reduce pollen transfer across species boundaries by pollinators and demonstrate that odour differences are an important component of premating ﬂoral isolation between closely related plant species.},

Despite this importance, there are surprisingly few examples of genes unequivocally responsible for variation in sexually selected phenotypes. This lack of information inhibits our ability to predict phenotypic change due to universal behaviours, such as ﬁghting over mates and mate choice. Here, we discuss reasons for this apparent gap and provide recommendations for how it can be overcome by adopting contemporary genomic methods, exploiting underutilized taxa that may be ideal for detecting the effects of sexual selection and adopting appropriate experimental paradigms. Identifying genes that determine variation in sexually selected traits has the potential to improve theoretical models and reveal whether the genetic changes underlying phenotypic novelty utilize common or unique molecular mechanisms. Such a genomic approach to sexual selection will help answer questions in the evolution of sexually selected phenotypes that were ﬁrst asked by Darwin and can furthermore serve as a model for the application of genomics in all areas of evolutionary biology.},

	abstract = {There has been a long-standing conceptual debate over the legitimacy of assigning components of offspring ®tness to parents for purposes of evolutionary analysis. The bene®ts and risks inherent in assigning ®tness of offspring to parents have been given primarily as verbal arguments and no explicit theoretical analyses have examined quantitatively how the assignment of ®tness can affect evolutionary inferences. Using a simple quantitative genetic model, we contrast the conclusions drawn about how selection acts on a maternal character when components of offspring ®tness (such as early survival) are assigned to parents vs. when they are assigned directly to the individual offspring. We ®nd that there are potential shortcomings of both possible assignments of ®tness. In general, whenever there is a genetic correlation between the parental and direct effects on offspring ®tness, assigning components of offspring ®tness to parents yields incorrect dynamical equations and may even lead to incorrect conclusions about the direction of evolution. Assignment of offspring ®tness to parents may also produce incorrect estimates of selection whenever environmental variation contributes to variance of the maternal trait. Whereas assignment of offspring ®tness to the offspring avoids these potential problems, it introduces the possible problem of missing components of kin selection provided by the mother, which may not be detected in selection analyses.

Similar questions can be addressed by modeling frameworks from population genetics, quantitative genetics, evolutionary game theory, or adaptive dynamics, or by individualbased simulations. Confronted with such diversity, nonspecialists may have difﬁculties judging the scope and limitations of the various approaches. Here we review the major modeling frameworks, highlighting their pros and cons when applied to different research questions. We also discuss recent developments, where classical models are enriched by including more detail regarding genetics, behavior, demography, and population dynamics. It turns out that some seemingly well-established conclusions of sexual selection theory are less general than previously thought. Linking sexual selection to other processes such as sex-ratio evolution or speciation also reveals that enriching the theory can lead to surprising new insights.},

	abstract = {Nocturnal pollination plays an important role in sexual plant reproduction but has been overlooked, partially because of intrinsic difficulties in field experimentation. Even less attention has received the effect of within-inflorescence spatial position (distal or proximal) on nocturnal pollinators of columnar plants, despite numerous studies examining the relationship between such position and reproductive success. Woody endemic Echium simplex possesses large erect inflorescences bearing thousands of flowers which are visited by a wide array of diurnal and nocturnal animals. In this study, we identified nocturnal visitors and compared their pollination effectiveness with that of diurnal pollinators in different inflorescence sections by means of selective exclosures in NE Tenerife (Canary Islands). Nocturnal visitors included at least ten morphospecies of moths (such as Paradrina rebeli and Eupithecia sp.), two coleopteran species (mainly Alloxantha sp.), neuropterans (Chrysoperla carnea), dictyopterans (Phyllodromica brullei), dermapterans (Guanchia sp.) and julidans (Ommatoiulus moreletii). In general, plants excluded from pollinators set less fruits than open-pollination (control) plants which set fruits homogeneously across sections. Diurnally pollinated plants set more fruit in their upper parts whereas nocturnally pollinated plants set fruit in both upper and bottom sections. We conclude that although the frequency and diversity of diurnal pollinators is far higher than that of nocturnal pollinators, both exhibit different foraging behaviour that generates complementary effects on the reproductive success of E. simplex.},

We established an experimental population of inbred and outbred Silene latifolia plants to evaluate the effects of (i) inbreeding depression, (ii) phenotypic variation and (iii) relatedness between mates on male fitness under natural pollination. Paternity analysis revealed that outbred males sired significantly more offspring than inbred males. Independently of the effects of inbreeding, male fitness depended on several male traits, including a sexually dimorphic (flower number) and a gametophytic trait ( in vitro pollen germination rate). In addition, full-sib matings were less frequent than randomly expected. Thus, inbreeding, phenotype and genetic dissimilarity simultaneously affect male fitness in this animal-pollinated plant. While inbreeding depression might threaten population persistence, the deficiency of effective matings between sibs and the higher fitness of outbred males will reduce its occurrence and counter genetic erosion.},

In this study we reviewed the evidence for phenotypic selection acting on ﬂowering phenology using ordinary and phylogenetic meta-analysis. Phenotypic selection exists when a phenotypic trait co-varies with ﬁtness; therefore, we looked for studies reporting an association between two components of ﬂowering phenology (ﬂowering time or ﬂowering synchrony) with ﬁtness. Data sets comprising 87 and 18 plant species were then used to assess the incidence and strength of phenotypic selection on ﬂowering time and ﬂowering synchrony, respectively. The inﬂuence of dependence on pollinators, the duration of the reproductive event, latitude and plant longevity as moderators of selection were also explored. Our results suggest that selection favours early ﬂowering plants, but the strength of selection is inﬂuenced by latitude, with selection being stronger in temperate environments. However, there is no consistent pattern of selection on ﬂowering synchrony. Our study demonstrates that phenotypic selection on ﬂowering time is consistent and relatively strong, in contrast to previous hypotheses of selective neutrality, and has implications for the evolution of temperate ﬂoras under global climate change.},

This consistent pattern seems at odds with life-history theory, which predicts stabilizing selection on age and size at reproduction. Why is selection for later ﬂowering rare? Moreover, extensive evidence demonstrates that ﬂowering time can and does evolve. What maintains ongoing directional selection for early ﬂowering? Several non-mutually exclusive processes can help to reconcile the apparent paradox of selection for early ﬂowering. We outline four: selection through other ﬁtness components may counter observed fecundity selection for early ﬂowering; asymmetry in the ﬂowering-time–ﬁtness function may make selection for later ﬂowering hard to detect; ﬂowering time and ﬁtness may be condition-dependent; and selection on ﬂowering duration is largely unaccounted for. In this Viewpoint, we develop these four mechanisms, and highlight areas where further study will improve our understanding of ﬂoweringtime evolution.},

	abstract = {Inga species present brush-type flower morphology allowing them to be visited by distinct groups of pollinators. Nectar features in relation to the main pollinators have seldom been studied in this genus. To test the hypothesis of floral adaptation to both diurnal and nocturnal pollinators, we studied the pollination ecology of Inga sessilis, with emphasis on the nectar secretion patterns, effects of sequential removals on nectar production, sugar composition and the role of diurnal and nocturnal pollinators in its reproductive success. Inga sessilis is self-incompatible and pollinated by hummingbirds, hawkmoths and bats. Fruit set under natural conditions is very low despite the fact that most stigmas receive polyads with sufficient pollen to fertilise all ovules in a flower. Nectar secretion starts in the bud stage and flowers continually secreting nectar for a period of 8 h. Flowers actively reabsorbed the nectar a few hours before senescence. Sugar production increased after nectar removal, especially when flowers were drained during the night. Nectar sugar composition changed over flower life span, from sucrose-dominant (just after flower opening, when hummingbirds were the main visitors) to hexose-rich (throughout the night, when bats and hawkmoths were the main visitors). Diurnal pollinators contributed less than nocturnal ones to fruit production, but the former were more constant and reliable visitors through time. Our results indicate I. sessilis has floral adaptations, beyond the morphology, that encompass both diurnal and nocturnal pollinator requirements, suggesting a complementary and mixed pollination system.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection is often quantiﬁed using Bateman gradients, which represent sex-speciﬁc regression slopes of reproductive success on mating success and thus describe the expected ﬁtness returns from mating more often. Although the analytical framework for Bateman gradients aimed at covering all sexual systems, empirical studies are biased toward separate-sex organisms, probably because important characteristics of other systems remain incompletely treated. Our synthesis complements the existing Bateman gradient approach with three essential reproductive features of simultaneous hermaphrodites. First, mating in one sex may affect ﬁtness via the opposite sex, for example, through energetic trade-offs. We integrate cross-sex selection effects and show how they help characterizing sexually mutualistic versus antagonistic selection. Second, male and female mating successes may be correlated, complicating the interpretation of Bateman gradients. We show how to quantify the impact of this correlation on sexual selection and propose a principal component analysis on male and female mating success to facilitate interpretation. Third, self-fertilization is accounted for by adding selfed progeny as a separate category of reproductive success to analyses of Bateman gradients. Finally, using a worked example from the snail Biomphalaria glabrata, we illustrate how the extended analytical framework can enhance our understanding of sexual selection in hermaphroditic animals and plants.},

	abstract = {Competition between males and their sperm over access to females and their eggs [1–3] has resulted in manifold ways by which males try to secure paternity, ranging from physically guarding the female after mating to reducing her receptivity or her attractiveness to subsequent males by transferring manipulative substances [4, 5] or by mechanically sealing the female reproductive tract with a copulatory plug [1, 3, 6]. Copulations may also result in internal damage of the female genitalia [7–9]; however, this is not considered as a direct adaptation against sperm competition but as a collateral effect [9–14]. Here, we present a drastic and direct mechanism for securing paternity: the removal of coupling structures on female genitalia by males. In the orbweaving spider Larinia jeskovi [15] males remove the scapus, a crucial coupling device on the female external genital region. Reconstruction of the coupling mechanism using micro-CT-scanned mating pairs revealed that several sclerites of the male genitalia interact to break off the scapus. Once it is removed, remating cannot occur due to mechanical coupling difﬁculties. In the ﬁeld, male-inﬂicted genital damage is very prevalent since all female L. jeskovi were found to be mutilated at the end of the mating season. External genital mutilation is an overlooked but widely spread phenomenon since 80 additional spider species were found for which male genital manipulation can be suspected. Interlocking genitalia provide an evolutionary platform for the rapid evolution of this highly effective mechanism to secure paternity, and we suspect that other animal groups with interlocking genital structures might reveal similarly drastic male adaptations.},

Thus, pollinators are simultaneously vital to supporting both natural ecosystems and human food security, which is a unique position for such a diverse group of organisms. The past two decades have seen unprecedented interest in pollinators and pollination ecology, stimulated in part by concerns about the decline of pollinator abundance and diversity in some parts of the world. This review synthesizes what is currently understood about the taxonomic diversity of organisms that are known to act as pollinators; their distribution in both deep time and present space; the importance of their diversity for ecological function (including agro-ecology); changes to diversity and abundance over more recent timescales, including introduction of non-native species; and a discussion of arguments for conserving their diversity.},

To compare the seed-siring success of competing pollen donors, a two-donor hand-pollination experiment with six donors and six recipients was conducted. The experiments were performed at a plastic-house seed orchard. The donors showed significant variation in pollen-tube growth rate on all the 11 recipients. The rankings of the pollen donors were statistically consistent across different maternal plants. A significant positive correlation between pollen tube growth in vivo and in vitro was found. The seedsiring success of two competing pollen donors was unequal in 20 of 29 cases and there was a significant positive correlation between seed-siring success and pollen-tube growth rate in vivo and in vitro. The results show that fertilizations are not random and pollen competition operates in a B. pendula seed orchard population.},

	abstract = {Animals may be careful in their choice of mates for a variety of reasons. The ideal mate may have to hold valuable resources as well as being highly fertile or fecund. As likely as not, it should be neither too closely related nor too distantly related, and it should be maximally attractive. All these aspects of a member of the opposite sex may influence how many descendants the pair could produce, but the importance of each will usually depend on the sex and the species of the individual making the choice. This book brings together modern thinking on the various functions of mate choice and its role in evolution. The ways in which finely tuned preferences for a particular member of the opposite sex develop are described, as is the importance of compatibility between mates in long-lived species. Finally, the book deals with the underlying mechanisms and the decision rules involved in choosing a mate. The different approaches of the authors combine to make an excellent overview of an attractive and fascinating topic. The book is particularly directed at students, teachers, and research workers, who are interested in evolution and behaviour, but the surveys it contains will be of considerable use to others whose main field of interest is in the social sciences.},

	abstract = {Flowering plants display spectacular floral diversity and a bewildering array of reproductive adaptations that promote mating, particularly outbreeding. A striking feature of this diversity is that related species often differ in pollination and mating systems, and intraspecific variation in sexual traits is not unusual, especially among herbaceous plants. This variation provides opportunities for evolutionary biologists to link micro-evolutionary processes to the macro-evolutionary patterns that are evident within lineages. Here, I provide some personal reflections on recent progress in our understanding of the ecology and evolution of plant reproductive diversity. I begin with a brief historical sketch of the major developments in this field and then focus on three of the most significant evolutionary transitions in the reproductive biology of flowering plants: the pathway from outcrossing to predominant self-fertilization, the origin of separate sexes (females and males) from hermaphroditism and the shift from animal pollination to wind pollination. For each evolutionary transition, I consider what we have discovered and some of the problems that still remain unsolved. I conclude by discussing how new approaches might influence future research in plant reproductive biology.},

	abstract = {Zoophilous flowers often transmit olfactory signals to attract pollinators. In plants with unisexual flowers, such signals are usually similar between the sexes because attraction of the same animal to both male and female flowers is essential for conspecific pollen transfer. Here, we present a remarkable example of sexual dimorphism in floral signal observed in reproductively highly specialized clades of the tribe Phyllantheae (Phyllanthaceae). These plants are pollinated by species-specific, seed-parasitic Epicephala moths (Gracillariidae) that actively collect pollen from male flowers and pollinate the female flowers in which they oviposit; by doing so, they ensure seeds for their offspring. We found that Epicephala -pollinated Phyllanthaceae plants consistently exhibit major qualitative differences in scent between male and female flowers, often involving compounds derived from different biosynthetic pathways. In a choice test, mated female Epicephala moths preferred the scent of male flowers over that of female flowers, suggesting that male floral scent elicits pollen-collecting behaviour. Epicephala pollination evolved multiple times in Phyllantheae, at least thrice accompanied by transition from sexual monomorphism to dimorphism in floral scent. This is the first example in which sexually dimorphic floral scent has evolved to signal an alternative reward provided by each sex, provoking the pollinator's legitimate altruistic behaviour.},

The scarcity of mates and pollinators can lead plant populations to suffer from pollen limitation and a decrease in reproductive performance within fragmented areas. We studied the shift in pollinator assemblages along with pollen limitation and seed production patterns in the Mediterranean shrub Myrtus communis. Our study included six populations contrasting in patch and population size (Large vs. Small) within a fragmented landscape characterized by \$1\% of potential forest coverage. The breeding system in Myrtus communis was self-compatible, but compared with natural pollination, fruit set increased with pollen addition (quantity limited), and seed set (brood size) increased with outcross pollen addition (quality limited). While the pollinator assemblage in Large patches was taxonomically diverse, it was almost monopolized by honeybees in Small patches, where visitation rates were highest and wild bee species were almost absent. In general, Small populations were less pollen limited for fruit set than Large populations, particularly those that received the highest rates of honeybee visits. However, despite differences in fragmentation and pollinators between Large and Small populations, seed production patterns (brood size and seed mass) were rather similar among them, in agreement with similar pollen limitation levels found for brood size. A higher susceptibility of native pollinators to the presence of honeybee hives was found in Small patches, suggesting that the pollinator assemblage may be severely altered when fragmentation occurs in combination with beekeeping. We discuss its implications and effects on plant reproduction in fragmented areas.},

I review empirical studies that use heritable markers to investigate per-fruit seed paternity in natural populations and after experimental multiple-donor pollination. Thirty-one studies covering 23 species from 16 plant families document that in natural populations seeds from a single fruit are often fathered by multiple pollen donors (5 species from 5 families), that donors can differ significantly in seed-siring success (8 species from 6 families), that variation in pollen tube growth rates can be heritable (n = 1 out of 4 studies), that donor and recipient genotypes can simultaneously affect paternity (n = 2), and that temporal order of pollen deposition (n = 1) and environmental effects (n = 2) affect the outcome of pollen competition. These studies also investigate the role of post-pollination selection in the avoidance of inbreeding and for species boundaries. Most studies of male reproductive success in plants to date base on isozyme electrophoresis. The availability in the last decade of highly polymorphic molecular markers such as microsatellite DNA has been expected to open new possibilities to investigate competition and selection during the gametophytic phase. Yet, to date, there is still need for greater data wealth on seed paternity to test theories of sex allocation and to gain deeper understanding of floral trait evolution and of the evolutionary consequences of post-pollination selection in flowering plants.},

	abstract = {Dioecious plants constitute 7\% of all angiosperm species, yet they occur in many habitat types, partially through the deployment of sexual dimorphisms that assist in reproduction. In the present work, the dioecious monocot Lomandra leucocephala ssp. robusta (Asparagaceae: Lomandroideae) was studied to understand how sexual dimorphisms can assist species conservation and inform us of a species’ potential signiﬁcance in an ecosystem. Floral display was sexually dimorphic, as male inﬂorescences were displayed more prominently and more conspicuously in UV range. Male nectar analysed by thin-layer chromatography contained a higher glucose content than female nectar. However, both sexes contained hexose-rich nectar, a common indicator of generalist pollination, which was supported by observations of ﬂoral visitors. Floral extract comparison conducted via gas chromatography-mass spectrometry showed that male extracts contained more compounds that potentially convey greater resistance to biotic and abiotic threats. Chemical comparison of leaves by high performance liquid chromatography with peak area ratio analysis revealed this technique could be used as a tool for gender identiﬁcation of individuals during non-ﬂowering periods. Due to the generalist pollination mechanisms of L. leucocephala ssp. robusta, may have an important role in the conservation and support of local insect populations. The presence of chemical biotic and abiotic resistance may also make L. leucocephala ssp. robusta a signiﬁcant contributor to the ongoing stabilisation of the sand dunes. Conservation efforts required for L. leucocephala ssp. robusta are likely to be minimal, as pollination services are provided by a diversity of pollinating taxa, including introduced species, which will be abundant regardless of variable ﬂowering periods. Further observational study of L. leucocephala ssp. robusta pollinators and differences in pollinator visitation behaviours between sexes is recommended to better understand efﬁcient pollination for the species, and potentially reveal a greater extent of ecosystem beneﬁt for this species.},

	abstract = {Biologists have long assumed that pollinator behavior is an important force in angiosperm speciation, yet there is surprisingly little direct evidence that ﬂoral preferences in pollinators can drive ﬂoral divergence and the evolution of reproductive (ethological) isolation between incipient plant species. In this study, we expose computer-generated plant populations with a wide variation in ﬂower color to selection by live and virtual hummingbirds and bumblebees and track evolutionary changes in ﬂower color over multiple generations. Flower color, which was derived from the known genetic architecture and phenotypic variance of naturally occurring plant species pollinated by both groups, evolved in simulations through a genetic algorithm in which pollinator preference determined changes in ﬂower color between generations. The observed preferences of live hummingbirds and bumblebees were strong enough to cause adaptive divergence in ﬂower color between plant populations but did not lead to ethological isolation. However, stronger preferences assigned to virtual pollinators in sympatric and allopatric scenarios rapidly produced ethological isolation. Pollinators can thus drive ecological speciation in ﬂowering plants, but more rigorous and comprehensive behavioral studies are required to specify conditions that produce sufﬁcient preference levels in pollinators.},

	abstract = {Two very basic ideas in sexual selection are heavily influenced by numbers of potential mates: the evolution of anisogamy, leading to sex role differentiation, and the frequency dependence of reproductive success that tends to equalize primary sex ratios. However, being explicit about the numbers of potential mates is not typical to most evolutionary theory of sexual selection. Here, we argue that this may prevent us from finding the appropriate ecological equilibria that determine the evolutionary endpoints of selection. We review both theoretical and empirical advances on how population density may influence aspects of mating systems such as intrasexual competition, female choice or resistance, and parental care. Density can have strong effects on selective pressures, whether or not there is phenotypic plasticity in individual strategies with respect to density. Mating skew may either increase or decrease with density, which may be aided or counteracted by changes in female behaviour. Switchpoints between alternative mating strategies can be density dependent, and mate encounter rates may influence mate choice (including mutual mate choice), multiple mating, female resistance to male mating attempts, mate searching, mate guarding, parental care, and the probability of divorce. Considering density-dependent selection may be essential for understanding how populations can persist at all despite sexual conflict, but simple models seem to fail to predict the diversity of observed responses in nature. This highlights the importance of considering the interaction between mating systems and population dynamics, and we strongly encourage further work in this area.},

Fragrance is a highly complex component of ﬂoral phenotype, with dynamic patterns of emission and chemical composition. The information content of speciﬁc volatile compounds is highly context dependent, and scent can function in direct and indirect ways from landscape to intraﬂoral scales. Floral scent promotes specialization in plant–pollinator relationships through private channels of unusual compounds, unique ratios of more widespread compounds, or through multicomponent ﬂoral ﬁlters. Floral scent also promotes outcrossing and reproductive isolation through ﬂoral constancy, via appetitive conditioning and discrimination on the basis of diverse mechanisms, including pheromone mimicry, odor intensity, complexity, composition, and synergy with visual stimuli. Finally, ﬂoral scent is a sexual signal and should be subject to the same selective pressures and modes of signal evolution as animal display, including signal honesty, sensory drive, and sensory exploitation.},

In marine organisms that broadcast spawn, however, females may encounter either sperm limitation or sperm competition. I measured the fertilization success of male and female Strongylocentrotus franciscanus over a range of population densities using microsatellite markers. Female fertilization success ﬁrst increased and then decreased with mate density, limited at low density by sperm limitation and at high density by polyspermy. Mate density affected variance in fertilization success in both males and females. In males, the variance in fertilization success increased with mate density. In females, the pattern was more complex. The variance in female success increased similarly to males with increased mate density but then decreased to low levels at intermediate densities, where almost all eggs were fertilized. As density increased further, the female variances again increased as polyspermy lowered average fertilization success. Male and female variances differed only at intermediate densities. At low densities, both sexes may be under selection to increase fertilization success; at intermediate densities, males may compete; and at high densities, both sexes may be under selection to increase success by increasing (males) or decreasing (females) likelihood of fertilization during sexual conﬂict. Only within a narrow range of densities do patterns of sexual selection mirror those typically noted in internally fertilizing taxa.},

	abstract = {Gynodioecy, the co-occurrence of females and hermaphrodites, is arguably the most common angiosperm gender polymorphism in many ﬂorae. Females’ ability to invade and persist among hermaphrodites depends, in part, on pollinators providing adequate pollination to females. We directly measured diurnal and nocturnal pollinators’ contributions to female and hermaphrodite seed production in artiﬁcial populations of gynodioecious Silene vulgaris by experimentally restricting pollinator access. We found that female relative seed production in this system depended strongly on pollination context: females produced more than twice as many seeds as hermaphrodites in the context of abundant, nectar-collecting moths. Conversely, females showed no seed production advantage in the context of pollen-collecting syrphid ﬂies and bees due to acutely hermaphrodite-biased visitation. We infer that variation in pollinator type, behaviour and abundance may be important for achieving the female relative ﬁtness thresholds necessary for the maintenance of gynodioecy. Generally, our study illustrates how pollinator-mediated mechanisms may inﬂuence the evolution of breeding systems and associated suites of ﬂoral traits. Segments of a pollinator community may facilitate gynodioecy by selecting for plant characteristics that increase the attractiveness of both sexes to pollinators, such as nectar rewards. Conversely, discriminating visitors in search of pollen may restrict gynodioecy in associated plant lineages by reducing male steriles’ ﬁtness below threshold levels.},

We found a positive association between reward amount (nectar sugar and pollen) and the ﬂoral scent compound phenylacetaldehyde. Bumble bees developed a preference for phenylacetaldehyde over other scent compounds after foraging on B. rapa. When foraging on artiﬁcial ﬂowers scented with synthetic volatiles, bumble bees developed a preference for those speciﬁc compounds that honestly indicated reward status. These results show that the honesty of ﬂoral signals can play a key role in their attractiveness to pollinators.

I found an overlap of 87\% in VOCs produced by plants and insects. ÔFloralÕ monoterpenes showed strong positive correlation in commonness between plants (both gymnosperms and angiosperms) and herbivores, whereas the commonness of ÔﬂoralÕ aromatics was positively correlated between angiosperms and both pollinators and herbivores. According to a multivariate regression analysis the commonness of ÔﬂoralÕ aromatics was best explained by their commonness in pollinators, whereas monoterpenes were best explained by herbivores. Among pollinator orders, aromatics were signiﬁcantly more common in Lepidoptera than in Hymenoptera, whereas monoterpenes showed no difference among the two orders. Collectively, these patterns suggest that plants and insects converge in overall patterns of volatile production, both for attraction and defence. Monoterpenes seem to have evolved primarily for defence under selection by herbivores, whereas aromatics evolved signalling functions in angiosperms, primarily for pollinator attraction.},

Flowering was observed throughout the year, and peaked twice in March and July. A total of 2210 individuals of 610 species in 12 orders of Insecta were observed on the flowers. The most abundant order was Diptera (32SO)6o of individuals), followed by Coleoptera (28906o), Hymenoptera (23SO)6e), Hemiptera (1 1 906o), Lepidoptera (4SO)6o). The bee fauna was composed of six families, 13 genera and 26 species, and characterized by dominance of small bees (e,g., Hylaeus, Lasioglossum and Andrena), large carpenter bees (Xylocopa) and long-tongued anthophorine bees (Tetralonia and Amegt'lla), and by absence of Bombus. The bee community contrasted with both the honeybee/stingless bee-dominated community in the Asian Tropics and the bumblebee-dominated community at temperate habitats. The rarity of social-bees is thought to result from seasonal and annual/supra-annual variability in floral resource on the islands. I inferred the pollinators of each plant species by examining flower-visitor communities, visitor behavior, pollen attachment on visitor's body and floral morphology. Among 104 plant species examined, the most dominant pollination type was melittophily (61\%), followed by myiophily (13906), unspecialized entomophily (9.6SO)6o), anemophily (6.7906), butterfly/hawkmoth-pollination (6.7SO)6) and cantharophily (2.9\%o). Among melittophilous species, small-bee-pollinated species (370/o) were most dominant, followed by XylocoPa-(21SO{\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}6o), Tetralonia-(17906), megachilid-(9.5SO)6), Amegilla-(7.9SO)6) and Colletes /APis-(6.39(of) and wasp-pollinated (1.6 9(of) species. The high proportions of those plants pollinated by long-tongued solitary bees (55.4SO{\textbackslash}vphantom\{\}6) contrasted with the high proportions of bumblebee-po]linated flowers on the mainland of Japan.},

	abstract = {Pollination and seed predation were studied in Silene vulgaris populations during two seasons, one with much lower pollinator abundance than the other. Among the pollinators, noctuid moths of the genus Hadena also acted as seed predators. Nectar-foraging female moths oviposited in flowers, and their larvae consumed flowers and seed capsules. Despite a lower percentage of pollinated flowers in the year of low pollinator abundance, similar numbers of flowers set fruit in both years, because fewer flower buds and flowers were eaten by Hadena larvae during the year of low pollinator visitation. The number of seed capsules preyed upon was also lower in the year with low pollinator abundance, resulting in a higher seed set. The positive correlation between the percentage of pollinated flowers and the percentage of seed capsules destroyed was also observed when comparing flowers opening in different parts of the season. Early flowering plant individuals had the same pollination success but suffered higher seed predation than late flowering ones. Selection for maximized pollination success through synchronous flowering, is probably the main reason for the compressed flowering period in 5. vulgaris, but the high level of predation early in the season may further increase the reproductive success of synchronous flowering individuals.},

	abstract = {Most plants attract multiple ﬂower visitors that may vary widely in their effectiveness as pollinators. Floral evolution is expected to reﬂect interactions with the most important pollinators, but few studies have quantiﬁed the contribution of different pollinators to current selection on ﬂoral traits. To compare selection mediated by diurnal and nocturnal pollinators on ﬂoral display and spur length in the rewarding orchid Gymnadenia conopsea, we manipulated the environment by conducting supplemental hand-pollinations and selective pollinator exclusions in two populations in central Norway. In both populations, the exclusion of diurnal pollinators signiﬁcantly reduced seed production compared to open pollination, whereas the exclusion of nocturnal pollinators did not. There was signiﬁcant selection on traits expected to inﬂuence pollinator attraction and pollination efﬁciency in both the diurnal and nocturnal pollination treatment. The relative strength of selection among plants exposed to diurnal and nocturnal visitors varied among traits and populations, but the direction of selection was consistent. The results suggest that diurnal pollinators are more important than nocturnal pollinators for seed production in the study populations, but that both categories contribute to selection on ﬂoral morphology. The study illustrates how experimental manipulations can link speciﬁc categories of pollinators to observed selection on ﬂoral traits, and thus improve our understanding of how species interactions shape patterns of selection.

	title = {Pollination context alters female advantage in gynodioecious \textit{{Silene}} vulgaris},
	abstract = {Gynodioecy, the co-occurrence of females and hermaphrodites, is arguably the most common angiosperm gender polymorphism in many ﬂorae. Females’ ability to invade and persist among hermaphrodites depends, in part, on pollinators providing adequate pollination to females. We directly measured diurnal and nocturnal pollinators’ contributions to female and hermaphrodite seed production in artiﬁcial populations of gynodioecious Silene vulgaris by experimentally restricting pollinator access. We found that female relative seed production in this system depended strongly on pollination context: females produced more than twice as many seeds as hermaphrodites in the context of abundant, nectar-collecting moths. Conversely, females showed no seed production advantage in the context of pollen-collecting syrphid ﬂies and bees due to acutely hermaphrodite-biased visitation. We infer that variation in pollinator type, behaviour and abundance may be important for achieving the female relative ﬁtness thresholds necessary for the maintenance of gynodioecy. Generally, our study illustrates how pollinator-mediated mechanisms may inﬂuence the evolution of breeding systems and associated suites of ﬂoral traits. Segments of a pollinator community may facilitate gynodioecy by selecting for plant characteristics that increase the attractiveness of both sexes to pollinators, such as nectar rewards. Conversely, discriminating visitors in search of pollen may restrict gynodioecy in associated plant lineages by reducing male steriles’ ﬁtness below threshold levels.},

	abstract = {The complex mutualism between yuccas and the moths that pollinate their flowers is regarded as one of the most obvious cases of coevolution. Studies of related genera show that at least two of the critical behavioral and life history traits suggested to have resulted from coevolved mutualism in yucca moths are plesiomorphic to the family. Another trait, oviposition into flowers, has evolved repeatedly within the family. One species with these traits, Greya politeUa, feeds on and pollinates plants of a different family, but pollination occurs through a different component of the oviposition behavior than in the yucca moths. Major differences compared with yucca moths and their hosts are that G. politeUa only passively pollinates its host and that copolators often contribute to pollination. This analysis suggests that evolution of mutualism between yuccas and yucca moths may have required few behavioral and life history changes in the moths. The truly coevolved features of this interaction appear to be the evolution of active pollination by the moths, the associated morphological structures in the moths for carrying pollen, and the exclusion of copollinators by yuccas.},

Yet current evidence does not allow satisfactory assessment of the causes or consequences of pollen limitation. Here, we critically evaluate existing theory and issues concerning pollen limitation. Our main conclusion is that a change in approach is needed to determine whether pollen limitation reﬂects random ﬂuctuations around a pollen–resource equilibrium, an adaptation to stochastic pollination environments, or a chronic syndrome caused by an environmental perturbation. We formalize and extend D. Haig and M. Westoby’s conceptual model, and illustrate its use in guiding research on the evolutionary consequences of pollen limitation, i.e., whether plants evolve or have evolved to ameliorate pollen limitation. This synthesis also reveals that we are only beginning to understand when and how pollen limitation at the plant level translates into effects on plant population dynamics. We highlight the need for both theoretical and empirical approaches to gain a deeper understanding of the importance of life-history characters, Allee effects, and environmental perturbations in population declines mediated by pollen limitation. Lastly, our synthesis identiﬁes a critical need for research on potential effects of pollen limitation at the community and ecosystem levels.},

Data were used to fit a model of pollen dispersal and to estimate the rates of pollen flow and mutation/genotyping error, by developing a new method. Selfing was rare (1.6\%). Pollen dispersed isotropically around each flowering plant following a leptokurtic distribution, with 50\% of mating pairs separated by less than 11 m, but 22\% by more than 40 m. Estimates of pollen flow lacked precision (0–25\%), partially because mutations and/or genotyping errors (0.03–1\%) could also explain the occurrence of offspring without a compatible candidate father. However, the pollen pool that fertilized these offspring was little differentiated from the adults of the population whereas strongly differentiated from the other populations, suggesting that pollen flow rate among populations was low. Our results suggest that pollen dispersal is too extended to allow differentiation by local adaptation within a population. However, among populations, gene flow might be low enough for such processes to occur.},

	abstract = {The number of sires fertilizing a given dam is a key parameter of the mating system in species with spatially restricted offspring dispersal, since genetic relatedness among maternal sibs determines the intensity of sib competition. In flowering plants, the extent of multiple paternity is determined by factors such as floral biology, properties of the pollen vector, selfing rate, spatial organization of the population, and genetic compatibility between neighbours. To assess the extent of multiple paternity and identify ecological factors involved, we performed a detailed study of mating patterns in a small population of a self-incompatible clonal herb, Arabidopsis halleri. We mapped and genotyped 364 individuals and 256 of their offspring at 12 microsatellite loci and jointly analysed the level of multiple paternity, pollen and seed dispersal, and spatial genetic structure. We found very low levels of correlated paternity among sibs (Pfull-sib = 3.8\%) indicating high multiple paternity. Our estimate of the outcrossing rate was 98.7\%, suggesting functional self-incompatibility. The pollen dispersal distribution was significantly restricted (mean effective pollen dispersal distance: 4.42 m) but long-distance successful pollination occurred and immigrating pollen was at most 10\% of all pollination events. Patterns of genetic structure indicated little extent of clonal reproduction, and a low but significant spatial genetic structure typical for a self-incompatible species. Overall, in spite of restricted pollen dispersal, the multiple paternity in this self-incompatible species was very high, a result that we interpret as a consequence of high plant density and high pollinator service in this population.},

The mean foraging distance of B. terrestris workers was 267.2 m ± 180.3 m (max. 800 m). Nearly 40\% of the workers foraged within 100 m around the nest. B. terrestris workers have thus rather moderate foraging ranges if rewarding forage is available within vicinity of the nests. We found the spatial distribution and the quality of forage plots to be the major determinants for the bees foraging decision-making, explaining over 80\% of the foraging frequency. This low foraging range has implications for using B. terrestris colonies as pollinators in agriculture.},

	abstract = {This paper reviewed the effects of insect pollination on the yield parameters of plants from the family Brassicaceae presenting different breeding systems. Meta-analysis indicates that in both self-compatible and self-incompatible crop species, meta-analysis indicates that seed yield (Y), silique set (SQS), number of siliquae/plant (NSQ), and the number of seeds/silique (NSSQ) increase when plants are insect-pollinated compared to when there is no insect pollination. The weight of seeds (WS), however, increased in self-incompatible species but not in self-compatible ones as a result of insect pollination. Overall, the percentage of studies showing a positive effect of insect pollination on yield parameters was higher in self-incompatible than in self-compatible species. It was shown that the ability of self-compatible species to reproduce does not fully compensate for the loss of yield benefits in the absence of insect pollination. Cultivated Brassicaceae attract a wide variety of pollinators, with honeybees (Apis spp.) such as A. mellifera L., A. cerana F., A. dorsata F., and A. florea F. (Hymenoptera: Apidae); other Apidae, such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.) (Hymenoptera: Apidae); mining bees (Hymenoptera: Andrenidae); sweat bees (Hymenoptera: Halictidae); and hoverflies (Diptera: Syrphidae) constituting the most common ones. The benefits of insect pollination imply that pollinator conservation programs play a key role in maximizing yield in cruciferous crops.},

Brassica napus and B. rapa are native to Eurasia. In Canada, these species are commonly referred to as volunteer canola, while feral populations of B. rapa are referred to as birdrape. Brassica napus and B. rapa have been grown commercially for their seed oil content in western Canada since the middle of the last century and volunteer populations are common in fields. Escaped populations of both species are also found along roadways, railways and in waste areas; however, only B. rapa is known to have naturalized, self-sustaining feral populations in these habitats in eastern Canada. Despite these escaped and feral populations, B. napus and B. rapa are mainly a concern in agricultural fields where their combined relative abundance has increased over the past few decades. In the mid 1990s, herbicideresistant genotypes of B. napus were released for commercial production. Herbicide-resistance and the stacking of genes in volunteer populations conferring resistance to multiple herbicides have contributed to increased difficulties in controlling volunteer B. napus in some crops. However, yield loss resulting from volunteer populations is not well documented in Canada.},

	abstract = {1. The honeybee Apis mellifera is currently in decline worldwide because of the combined impacts of Colony Collapse Disorder and the Varroa destructor mite. In order to gain a balanced perspective of the importance of both wild and managed pollination services, it is essential to compare these services directly, a priori, within a cropping landscape. This process will determine the capacity of other flower visitors to act as honeybee replacements. 2. In a highly modified New Zealand agricultural landscape, we compared the pollination services provided by managed honeybees to unmanaged pollinator taxa (including flies) within a Brassica rapa var. chinensis mass flowering crop. 3. We evaluate overall pollinator effectiveness by separating the pollination service into two components: efficiency (i.e. per visit pollen deposition) and visit rate (i.e. pollinator abundance per available flower and the number of flower visits per minute). 4. We observed 31 species attending flowers of B. rapa. In addition to A. mellifera, seven insect species visited flowers frequently. These were three other bees (Lasioglossum sordidum, Bombus terrestris and Leioproctus sp.) and four flies (Dilophus nigrostigma, Melanostoma fasciatum, Melangyna novae-zelandiae and Eristalis tenax). 5. Two bee species, Bombus terrestris and Leioproctus sp. and one fly, Eristalis tenax were as efficient as the honeybee and as effective (in terms of rate of flower visitation). A higher honeybee abundance, however, resulted in it being the more effective pollinator overall. 6. Synthesis and applications. Alternative land management practices that increase the population sizes of unmanaged pollinator taxa to levels resulting in visitation frequencies as high as A. mellifera, have the potential to replace services provided by the honeybee. This will require a thorough investigation of each taxon’s intrinsic biology and a change in land management practices to ensure year round refuge, feeding, nesting and other resource requirements of pollinator taxa are met.},

	abstract = {Quantitative aspects of the study of animal and human behaviour are increasingly relevant to test hypotheses and find empirical support for them. At the same time, photo and video cameras can store a large number of video recordings and are often used to monitor the subjects remotely. Researchers frequently face the need to code considerable quantities of video recordings with relatively flexible software, often constrained by species-specific options or exact settings. BORIS is a free, open-source and multiplatform standalone program that allows a user-specific coding environment to be set for a computer-based review of previously recorded videos or live observations. Being open to user-specific settings, the program allows a project-based ethogram to be defined that can then be shared with collaborators, or can be imported or modified. Projects created in BORIS can include a list of observations, and each observation may include one or two videos (e.g. simultaneous screening of visual stimuli and the subject being tested; recordings from different sides of an aquarium). Once the user has set an ethogram, including state or point events or both, coding can be performed using previously assigned keys on the computer keyboard. BORIS allows definition of an unlimited number of events (states/point events) and subjects. Once the coding process is completed, the program can extract a time-budget or single or grouped observations automatically and present an at-a-glance summary of the main behavioural features. The observation data and time-budget analysis can be exported in many common formats (TSV, CSV, ODF, XLS, SQL and JSON). The observed events can be plotted and exported in various graphic formats (SVG, PNG, JPG, TIFF, EPS and PDF).},

Product indicator methods of examining latent interactions provide an accurate method to estimate and test latent interactions and can be implemented in any latent variable modeling software package. Significant latent interactions require additional steps (plotting and probing) to interpret interaction effects. We demonstrate how these methods can be easily implemented using functions in the semTools package with models fit using the lavaan package in R, and we illustrate how these methods work using an applied example concerning teacher stress and testing.},

The Bateman gradient relates reproductive success to mate number, and Bateman presented this as the cause of intra-masculine selection. A deeper causal level was subsequently asserted: that the ultimate cause of sex differences in Bateman gradients is the sex difference in gamete numbers, an argument that remains controversial and without mathematical backup. Here I develop models showing how asymmetry in gamete numbers alone can generate steeper Bateman gradients in males. This conclusion remains when the further asymmetry of internal fertilisation is added to the model and fertilisation is efficient. Strong gamete limitation can push Bateman gradients towards equality under external fertilisation and reverse them under internal fertilisation. Thus, this study provides a mathematical formalisation of Bateman’s brief verbal claim, while demonstrating that the link between gamete number and Bateman gradients is not inevitable nor trivial.},

We found that plants under selection by bee pollinators evolved increased floral attractiveness, but this process was compromised by the presence of herbivores. Plants under selection from both bee pollinators and herbivores evolved higher degrees of self-compatibility and autonomous selfing, as well as reduced spatial separation of sexual organs (herkogamy).

Plant height is often under pollinator-mediated selection, and has been shown to be correlated with various other traits. However, few studies have examined the evolutionary trajectory of plant height under selection and the pleiotropic effects of plant height evolution. We conducted a bi-directional artificial selection experiment on plant height with fast cycling Brassica rapa plants to estimate its heritability and genetic correlations, and to reveal evolutionary responses to artificial selection on height and various correlated traits. With the divergent lines obtained through artificial selection, we subsequently conducted pollinator-choice assays and investigated resource limitation of fruit production. We found that plant height variation is strongly genetically controlled (with a realized heritability of 41–59\%). Thus, plant height can evolve rapidly under phenotypic selection. In addition, we found remarkable pleiotropic effects in phenology, morphology, floral scent, color, nectar and leaf glucosinolates. Most traits were increased in tall-line plants, but flower size, UV reflection and glucosinolates were decreased, indicating potential trade-offs. Pollinators preferred plants of the tall selection lines over the short selection lines in both greenhouse experiments with bumblebees and field experiment with natural pollinators. We did not detect any differences in resource limitation between plants of the different selection lines. Overall, our study predicts that increased height should evolve under positive pollinator-mediated directional selection with potential trade-offs in floral signals and herbivore defense.},

Dispersal of B. terrestris gained momentum in the 1980s when bees were reared artiﬁcially in Europe and supplied commercially for greenhouse pollination services. Very early after its commercial introduction, it was recognized that this species is invasive, can island hop to new locations and may disturb local ecosystems. The invasive characteristics of B. terrestris are: high migration ability, early seasonal emergence, high adaptability under adverse climatic conditions in various habitats, generalist or polylectic foraging strategies, enabling it to work a wide variety of ﬂowers for resources, foraging over wide distances, a thermoregulatory metabolism that enables it to withstand low temperatures, no natural enemies to check population growth in areas outside its natural range, and it may develop two reproductive cycles in a year (bivoltine) in a newly colonized area. In addition, commercial bees produce more gynes and are better competitors than the local conspeciﬁc populations and may replace them in the likely event of an escape. The documented evidence on invasive impact of B. terrestris on natural ecosystems includes: negative interactions with local bee fauna, competition for nest sites with, and genetic contamination of, local Bombus spp., spread of parasites and pathogens and negative interactions with plant reproductive capacity. We discuss the possible measures that must be taken to minimize the B. terrestris invasion on local as well as on global levels.},

	abstract = {Widespread concerns about declines of wild pollinating insects has attracted considerable research interest, largely directed towards identifying key nectar sources and assessing the contribution of pollinators towards ecosystem services. However, previous work has almost exclusively focussed on bees and other diurnal invertebrate taxa. This study aimed to assess the relative contribution of diurnal and nocturnal insects to the pollination of bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg.), a common and widespread species aggregate across Europe, which has been identified as a key source of pollen and nectar for diurnal pollinators. Bramble flower visitation rates by diurnal and nocturnal insects were quantified by analysing over 380,000 interval photographs taken over a 3-day period across 10 sites. A pollinator exclusion experiment was also undertaken to assess the importance of diurnal and nocturnal insects for pollination by analysing pollen deposition on 480 bramble stigmas of nocturnally exposed, diurnally exposed and unvisited control flowers across all sites. Flower visitation was significantly higher during the day, comprising 83\% of all visits made by a range of taxa. Nocturnal visitation was almost exclusively by moths. Crucially, pollen deposition rates of bramble were significantly higher during the night compared with the day. No relationship was detected between pollen counts and flower visitation rates, suggesting that moths are more efficient pollinators of bramble compared with diurnal insects. Overall, this work provides further evidence of the value of bramble as a resource for pollinators and demonstrates that moths likely play an important role in bramble pollination.},

Insects can locate their hosts even though the host plants are often hidden among an array of other plants. Plant volatiles play an important role in this host-location process. The recognition of a host plant by these olfactory signals could occur by using either species-specific compounds or specific ratios of ubiquitous compounds. Currently, most studies favor the second scenario, with strong evidence that plant discrimination is due to central processing of olfactory signals by the insect, rather than their initial detection. Furthermore, paired or clustered olfactory receptor neurons might enable fine-scale spatio-temporal resolution of the complex signals encountered when ubiquitous compounds are used.},

Although some plants engaged in such interactions emit singular compounds, others emit mixtures of VOCs commonly emitted by plants. We investigated the chemical ecological bases of host plant recognition in the nursery pollination mutualism between the dioecious Ficus carica and its specific pollinator Blastophaga psenes. Using Y-tube olfactometer tests, we show that B. psenes females are attracted by VOCs of receptive figs of both sexes and do not exhibit preference for VOCs of either male or female figs. Electrophysiological tests and chemical analysis revealed that of all the VOCs emitted by receptive figs, only five were found to be active on female antennae. Behavioural tests show that, in contrast to VOCs presented alone, only a blend with a particular proportion of four of these VOCs is as attractive as the odour of receptive figs, and that if there is a very small change in this blend proportion, the pollinator is no longer attracted. This study revealed that in highly specialized mutualistic interactions specificity could be mediated by a particular blend of common compounds emitted by plants.},

We used both conventional methods (F statistic and analysis of molecular variance) and more recently developed methods (Structure and Population Graphs) to describe the genetic structure of 13 Aquilegia coerulea populations across four geographic areas. Gene flow played an important role in explaining the distribution of genetic diversity over the landscape in A. coerulea populations. We detected significant isolation by distance and identified long-distance dispersal events and instances of restricted gene flow. The long-distance dispersal events explained some of the genetic similarities observed among populations from different regions. Restricted gene flow contributed to the genetic differentiation detected among populations within some regions. Populations in Utah represented the most likely center of the range for this group of populations. The mating system had little influence on the distribution of genetic diversity, and the abundance of the two main pollinators did not explain differences among populations from different regions. Fire and differences in flowering phenology with altitude, combined with aggregated populations, limited gene flow and increased the genetic differentiation of some geographically close populations.},

Previous studies have given conflicting results regarding the significance of pollination mode, seed dispersal mode, mating system, growth form and latitudinal region in shaping patterns of genetic structure, as estimated by FST values, and no study to date has tested their relative importance together across a broad scale. Here, we assembled a 337-species data set for seed plants from publications with data on FST from nuclear markers and species traits, including variables pertaining to the sampling scheme of each study. We used species traits, while accounting for sampling variables, to perform phylogenetic multiple regressions. Results demonstrated that FST values were higher for tropical, mixed-mating, non-woody species pollinated by small insects, indicating greater population differentiation, and lower for temperate, outcrossing trees pollinated by wind. Among the factors we tested, latitudinal region explained the largest portion of variance, followed by pollination mode, mating system and growth form, while seed dispersal mode did not significantly relate to FST. Our analyses provide the most robust and comprehensive evaluation to date of the main ecological factors predicted to drive population differentiation in seed plants, with important implications for understanding the basis of their genetic divergence. Our study supports previous findings showing greater population differentiation in tropical regions and is the first that we are aware of to robustly demonstrate greater population differentiation in species pollinated by small insects.},

	abstract = {In animal-pollinated angiosperms, the ‘male-function’ hypothesis claims that male reproductive success (RS) should benefit from large floral displays, through pollinator attraction, while female RS is expected to be mainly limited by resource availability. As appealing as this theory might be, studies comparing selection strength on flower number in both sexes rarely document the expected asymmetry. This discrepancy could arise because flower number impacts both pollinator attraction and overall gamete number. In this study, we artificially manipulate floral displays to disentangle the fertility versus pollinator attraction components of selection, both in terms of mating and RS. In females, flower number was under strong fertility selection, as predicted in the absence of pollen limitation. By contrast, in males, flower number was mainly under sexual selection, which in turn increased male RS. However, these selection patterns were not different in males with artificially increased floral displays. This suggests that sexual selection acting on flower number in males does not occur because flower number increases pollinator attraction, but rather because more pollen is available to disperse on more mates. Our study illustrates the power of disentangling various components of selection with potentially sex-specific effects for understanding the evolution of sexual dimorphism.},

In insect-pollinated plants, competition to attract pollinators is expected to result in pollinator-mediated selection on attractive floral traits. This could overlap with sexual selection if the number of mating partners increases with pollinator attraction, resulting in an improved reproductive success. In this study, we measured a set of floral traits and estimated individual fitness in male and female Silene dioica in an experimental population. Results align with the predictions of Bateman's principles, in the absence of pollen limitation. In females, natural selection acted on traits that are typically linked with fertility (number of flowers and number of gametes), and selection strength was similar in open- and hand-pollinated females, suggesting a limited role of pollinator-mediated selection. In males, flowering duration and corolla width were positively associated with both reproductive success and number of mates, suggesting that sexual selection has played a role in the evolution of these traits. The use of Bateman's metrics further confirmed stronger sexual selection in males than in females. Taken together, our results shed light on the occurrence of sex-specific patterns of selection in an insect-pollinated plant population.},

However, links between pollinator activity and multiple paternity are generally lacking, especially for plant species that attract functionally diverse floral visitors. In this study, we separated the influence of two functionally distinct floral visitors (hawkmoths and solitary bees) and characterized their impacts on multiple paternity in a self-incompatible, annual forb, Oenothera harringtonii (Onagraceae). We also situated pollinator-mediated effects in a spatial context by linking variation in multiple paternity to variation in plant spatial isolation. We documented pronounced differences in the number of paternal sires as function of pollinator identity: on average, the primary pollinator (hawkmoths) facilitated mating with nearly twice as many pollen donors relative to the secondary pollinator (solitary bees). This effect was consistent for both isolated and nonisolated individuals, but spatial isolation imposed pronounced reductions on multiple paternity regardless of pollinator identity. Considering that pollinator abundance and pollen dispersal distance did not vary significantly with pollinator identity, we attribute variation in realized mating dynamics primarily to differences in pollinator morphology and behaviour as opposed to pollinator abundance or mating incompatibility arising from underlying spatial genetic structure. Our findings demonstrate that functionally distinct pollinators can have strongly divergent effects on polyandry in plants and further suggest that both pollinator identity and spatial heterogeneity have important roles in plant mating dynamics.},

	abstract = {Land-use change is among the top drivers of global biodiversity loss, which impacts the arrangement and distribution of suitable habitat for species. Population-level effects include increased isolation, decreased population size, and changes to mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. However, the extent to which species are impacted is determined by life history characteristics including dispersal. In plants, mating dynamics can be changed in ways that can negatively impact population persistence if dispersal of pollen and/or seed is disrupted. Long-distance dispersal has the potential to buffer species from the negative impacts of land-use change. Biotic vectors of long-distance dispersal have been less frequently studied, though specific taxa are known to travel great distances. Here, we describe population genetic diversity and structure in a sphingophilous species that is experiencing habitat fragmentation through land-use change, Oenothera harringtonii W. L. Wagner, Stockh. \& W. M. Klein (Onagraceae). We use 12 nuclear and four plastid microsatellite markers and show that pollen dispersal by hawkmoths drives high gene flow and low population differentiation despite a range-wide gradient of land-use change and habitat fragmentation. By separating the contributions of pollen and seed dispersal to gene flow, we show that most of the genetic parameters are driven by hawkmoth-facilitated long-distance pollen dispersal, but populations with small, effective population sizes experience higher levels of relatedness and inbreeding. We discuss considerations for conservation efforts for this and other species that are pollinated by long-distance dispersers.},

	abstract = {Pollinators influence patterns of plant speciation, and one intuitive hypothesis is that pollinators affect rates of plant diversification through their effects on pollen dispersal. By specifying mating events and pollen flow across the landscape, distinct types of pollinators may cause different opportunities for allopatric speciation. This pollen dispersal-dependent speciation hypothesis predicts that pollination mode has effects on the spatial context of mating events that scale up to impact population structure and rates of species formation. Here I consider recent comparative studies, including genetic analyses of plant mating events, population structure and comparative phylogenetic analyses, to examine evidence for this model. These studies suggest that highly mobile pollinators conduct greater gene flow within and among populations, compared to less mobile pollinators. These differences influence patterns of population structure across the landscape. However, the effects of pollination mode on speciation rates is less predictable. In some contexts, the predicted effects of pollen dispersal are outweighed by other factors that govern speciation rates. A multiscale approach to examine effects of pollination mode on plant mating system, population structure and rates of diversification is key to determining the role of pollen dispersal on plant speciation for model clades.},

To understand how environmental factors affect plant–pollinator interactions, it is critical that studies include the entire diel cycle to examine patterns and processes that cause temporal variations. Further, there is little information from the Arctic, where environmental conditions that influence pollinator activity (e.g. temperature and solar radiation), are less variable across the diel cycle during the summer compared to locations from lower latitudes. We quantified abundance, composition and foraging activity of a pollinator community in Finnish Lapland at a diel scale over two summers, one of which was an extreme heat year. Pollinators showed a robust pattern in daily foraging activity, with peak activity during the day, less to no activity at night, and an absence of typically night active Lepidoptera. Abundance and composition of pollinators differed significantly between the years, possibly in response to the extreme heat in one of the years, which may particularly harm muscid flies. Our results showing strong diel and interannual abundance patterns for several taxa of pollinators in the Arctic summer have important implications for our understanding of temporal dynamics of plant–pollinator interactions.},

As a consequence, we have a limited understanding of the diversity and activity of flower visitors during the night or belonging to taxa other than bees or syrphid flies. Here, we quantified the abundance and species richness of flower visitors in ruderal meadows over repeated 24-h cycles (i.e. day and night), and identified abiotic factors influencing these patterns. From the plant perspective, we investigated the likelihood of being visited by an insect across a 24-h cycle. Activity of flower-visiting insects never dropped to zero over 24-h. During the day, non-syrphid Diptera and Hymenoptera were the most abundant, and species-rich groups of flower visitors, Lepidoptera and Coleoptera during night. While two of the seven most frequently visited plant species were most likely to be visited during the day, five also had a high likelihood to be visited during the night. The abundance and species richness of flower visitors was positively related to temperature during both the day and the night, whereas there was only a positive relationship with brightness during the day. We conclude that non-syrphid Diptera and nocturnal flower visitors are currently underappreciated. As the latter seem to respond differently to abiotic factors compared to diurnal species, they may potentially increase response diversity and resilience of plant-pollinator communities. There is an urgent need to improve our understanding of their ecological role and potential decline due to global change.},

We observed natural populations of S. alba to document the most abundant insect visitors, which include syrphid flies, andrenid bees, bumblebees and a variety of nocturnal moths. Using bumblebees and moths in flower preference studies, we showed that bumblebees preferentially visited healthy flowers, but the strength of this preference declined if the bees had prior exposure to diseased flowers. Nocturnal moths showed less discrimination with respect to disease status when plants were arranged in a field population of S. alba, and preferentially visited plants with more flowers. A laboratory analysis of spore deposition by bumblebees showed that whereas most spores were deposited on the first several flowers visited, flowers beyond the 15th visit may still receive enough spores to produce a new infection. Spore deposition was also influenced by changes in vector behavior associated with spacing in artificial arrays of S. alba plants. Models were fitted to deposition data to compare estimates for spore dispersal rates and the initial number of spores acquired by vectors. This study demonstrated several ways that vector behavior can influence rates of disease spread in natural populations. Preferences for healthy vs. infected hosts can cause disease dispersal to vary from that expected by randomly foraging insect vectors. Changes in visitation behavior associated with host density can affect the magnitude and distance of spore deposition in host populations.},

Diurnal bees, Tetralonia nipponensis and Lasioglossum sp., delivered more pollen grains than the nocturnal hawkmoth Theretra japonica per visit, suggesting that these bees were also effective pollinators. However, these bees removed over 10 times more pollen at one visit than the hawkmoth. Because of the higher pollen consumption by these bees, anthesis at dusk is considered to be optimal for Lonicera japonica to maximize overall pollen transfer under the visitation of both nocturnal and diurnal pollinators. Tetralonia japonica dispersed color dye farther than the other pollinators, which suggests that the nocturnal pollinator contributes more to cross-pollination than the diurnal pollinators.Key words: Lonicera japonica, hawkmoth-pollinated flowers, pollinator efficiency, pollen removal, pollination syndromes, timing of anthesis.},

One model for evolutionary shifts from bee pollination to bird pollination has assumed that, mostly due to grooming, pollen on bee bodies quickly becomes unavailable for transfer to stigmas, whereas pollen on hummingbirds has greater carryover. Comparing bumblebees and hummingbirds seeking nectar in P. strictus, we confirmed that bees had a steeper pollen carryover curve than birds but, surprisingly, bees and birds removed similar amounts of pollen and had similar per‐visit pollen transfer efficiencies. Comparing P. barbatus and P. strictus visited by hummingbirds, the bird‐syndrome flowers had more pollen removed, more pollen deposited, and a higher transfer efficiency than the bee‐syndrome flowers. In addition, P. barbatus flowers have evolved such that their anthers and stigmas would not easily come into contact with bumblebees if they were to forage on them. We discuss the role that differences in pollination efficiency between bees and hummingbirds may have played in the repeated evolution of hummingbird pollination in Penstemon.},

	abstract = {In the Silene latifolia–Hadena bicruris nursery pollination system, the Hadena moth is both pollinator and seed predator of its host plant. Floral scent, which differs among S. latifolia individuals and populations, is important for adult Hadena to locate its host. However, the success of moth larvae is strongly reduced if hosts are infected by the anther smut fungus Microbotryum violaceum, a pathogen that is transmitted by flower visitors. There were no qualitative differences between the scent of flowers from healthy and diseased plants. In addition, electroantennographic measurements showed that Hadena responded to the same subset of 19 compounds in samples collected from healthy and diseased plants. However, there were significant quantitative differences in scent profiles. Flowers from diseased plants emitted both a lower absolute amount of floral scent and had a different scent pattern, mainly due to their lower absolute amount of lilac aldehyde, whereas their amount of (E)-β-ocimene was similar to that in healthy flowers. Dual choice behavioral wind tunnel tests using differently scented flowers confirmed that moths respond to both qualitative and quantitative aspects of floral scent, suggesting that they could use differences in floral scent between healthy and infected plants to discriminate against diseased plants. Population mean fruit predation rates significantly increased with population mean levels of the emission rates of lilac aldehyde per flower, indicating that selection on floral scent compounds may not only be driven by effects on pollinator attraction but also by effects on fruit predation. However, variation in mean emission rates of scent compounds per flower generally could not explain the higher fruit predation in populations originating from the introduced North American range compared to populations native to Europe.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Pollinating seed predators are models for the study of mutualisms. These insects have dual effects on host-plant fitness, through pollination as adults and flower and fruit predation as larvae. A rarely examined question is whether pollinating seed-predator oviposition choices are influenced by plant floral and size traits and the potential consequences of oviposition for host-plant reproduction. •
METHODS: We quantified oviposition by a pollinating seed predator, Hadena ectypa, on its host, Silene stellata, to determine if oviposition was associated with specific plant traits and whether oviposition was significantly correlated with fruit initiation or flower and fruit predation over three years. We also quantified whether stigmatic pollen loads of flowers visited by Hadena that both fed on nectar and oviposited were greater than when Hadena only fed on nectar. •
KEY RESULTS: Hadena had significant preference for plants having flowers with long corolla tubes in all three years. Moth oviposition was correlated with other traits only in some years. Oviposition did not increase stigmatic pollen loads. We observed significant positive relationships between both oviposition and fruit initiation and oviposition and flower/fruit predation. •
CONCLUSIONS: Hadena ectypa oviposition choices were based consistently on floral tube length differences among individuals, and the consequences of oviposition include both fruit initiation (due to pollination while feeding on nectar prior to oviposition) and larval flower/fruit predation. The positive association between oviposition and fruit initiation may explain the long-term maintenance of facultative pollinating seed-predator interactions.},

	abstract = {Gynodioecy, the co-occurrence of hermaphrodite and female individuals within a species, is maintained by differential reproductive success between sexes. Recently, researchers recognized that not only pollinators but also herbivores are important agents in the evolution and maintenance of gynodioecy, when herbivory is hermaphrodite biased. In this study, we investigated whether there is hermaphrodite-biased herbivory in a gynodioecious plant, Dianthus superbus var. longicalycinus, and if so, what floral traits influenced hermaphrodite-biased herbivory. We measured flower morphology (flower diameter, calyx tube length, corolla height and petal width) and phenology of flowers of female individuals, hermaphrodites and gynomonoecious individuals in a natural population. We also investigated seed predation and predator species. At the study site, Sibinia weevils (Curculionidae; Coleoptera) and Coleophora moths (Coleophoridae; Lepidoptera) were common pre-dispersal seed predators in this species. The weevil appeared early in the flowering season, and weevil predation correlated with flower phenology. Because female individuals did not flower early in the season, weevil predation was less frequent in female individuals. Moth predation correlated with calyx length. The calyx length of flowers of female individuals was smaller than those of hermaphrodites, but a direct comparison of moth predation rates failed to find a significant difference among sex morphs. We found that the two seed predators had different effects on floral traits in D. superbus var. longicalycinus. We suggest that weevil predation contributes to the maintenance of gynodioecy because female individuals successfully escaped weevil predation by flowering late. It remains unclear why flower phenology is different among sex morphs.},

	abstract = {Premise of research. Selection on floral traits by pollinators is expected to play a key role in the diversification of floral phenotypes and the maintenance of species boundaries in sympatry. However, relatively few studies have tested the generality of these assumptions in natural systems, and fewer still have examined multiple phenotypes to better understand which ones are most important to pollinators.

Methodology. We created F2 hybrids between two sympatric species of dioecious Silene to segregate groups of floral characteristics from their associated pollination syndromes. Arrays of hybrid female plants were placed among natural field populations, where we observed native pollinators (diurnal and crepuscular) in order to address which individual traits or groups of traits influenced pollinator visitation, seed set, or predation. Pollinator visits included bees, bee flies, butterflies, and moths, including the mutualist nursery pollinator/seed predator Hadena bicruris.

Pivotal results. Regardless of time of day, large flowers and tall plants had higher visitation rates. However, large flowers and tall plants were also more likely to be preyed on by H. bicruris. In all treatments, pollinators showed no preferences for flower color, despite the hypothesized general importance of color for pollinator attraction.

Conclusions. Floral phenotypes are the result of both floral preferences by pollinators and antagonistic interactions with floral predators in this system. These findings provide further empirical evidence that floral traits may be important for maintaining species boundaries.},

	abstract = {Floral traits often display sexual dimorphism in insect-pollinated dioecious plant species, with male individuals typically being showier than females. While this strategy is theorized to be optimal when pollinators are abundant, it might represent a risk when they become scarce, because the disproportionately high number of visits on the most attractive sex, males, might preclude efficient pollen transfer from males to females. Here, the effect of sexual dimorphism on pollination efficiency was assessed in experimental arrays of dioecious Silene dioica that were exposed to one frequent visitor of the species, Bombus terrestris, and that differed in the magnitude of sexual dimorphism for either flower number or flower size. We found that flower number dimorphism negatively affected the number of visits on female plants, on female flowers and on the number of female flowers visited after a male flower. However, flower number dimorphism had no effect on the number of pollen grains deposited per stigma, presumably because the decrease in the number of visits to female flowers was compensated by a higher number of pollen grains deposited per visit. Flower size dimorphism did not affect visitation patterns and pollen transfer in our experimental arrays. These results highlight the need to jointly study visitation patterns and pollen receipt on stigmas when exploring the effect on floral phenotypes on pollination efficiency.},

We artificially generated 48 plant phenotypes corresponding to all combinations of key attractive traits differing among the three Silene species (color, height, inflorescence architecture, flower orientation, and corolla-tube width). We quantified main and interaction effects of trait manipulation on hummingbird visitation preference using experimental arrays. The main effects of floral display height and floral orientation strongly influenced hummingbird visitation, with hummingbirds preferring flowers held high above the ground and vertically to the sky. Hummingbirds also prefer traits in a nonadditive manner as multiple two-way and higher order interaction effects were important predictors of hummingbird visitation. Contemporary trait combinations found in hummingbird pollinated S. virginica are mostly preferred. Our study demonstrates the likelihood of pollination syndromes evolving due to selection on trait combinations and highlights the importance of trait interactions in understanding the evolution of complex adaptations.},

	abstract = {Premise The role of pollinators in evolutionary floral divergence has spurred substantial effort into measuring pollinator-mediated phenotypic selection and its variation in space and time. For such estimates, the fitness consequences of pollination processes must be separated from other factors affecting fitness. Methods We built a fitness function linking phenotypic traits of food-deceptive orchids to female reproductive success by including pollinator visitation and pollen deposition as intermediate performance components and used the fitness function to estimate the strength of pollinator-mediated selection through female reproductive success. We also quantified male performance as pollinarium removal and assessed similarity in trait effects on male and female performance. Results The proportion of plants visited at least once by an effective pollinator was moderate to high, ranging from 53.7\% to 85.1\%. Tall, many-flowered plants were often more likely to be visited and pollinated. Given effective pollination, pollen deposition onto stigmas tended to be more likely for taller plants. Pollen deposition further depended on traits affecting the physical fit of pollinators to flowers (flower size, spur length), though the exact relationships varied in time and space. Using the fitness function to assess pollinator-mediated selection through female reproductive success acting on multiple traits, we found that selection varied detectably among taxa after accounting for sampling uncertainty. Across taxa, selection on most traits was stronger on average and more variable when pollination was less reliable. Conclusions These results support pollination-related trait–performance–fitness relationships and thus pollinator-mediated selection on traits functionally involved in the pollination process.},

An examination of the history of sexual selection research shows prevalent male precedence—that research starts with male-centered investigations or explanations and thereafter includes female-centered equivalents. In comparison, the incidence of female precedence is low. Furthermore, a comparison between the volume of publications focusing on sexual selection in males versus in females shows that the former far outnumber the latter. This bias is not only a historical pattern; sexual selection theory and research are still male-centered—due to conspicuous traits, practical obstacles, and continued gender bias. Even the way sexual selection is commonly defined contributes to this bias. This history provides an illustrative example by which we can learn to recognize biases and identify gaps in knowledge. I conclude with a call for the scientific community to interrogate its own biases and suggest strategies for alleviating biases in this field and beyond.},

	abstract = {Pollinator behavior influences plant reproduction in many ways. A traditional measure of pollination, the number of visits received, may be a poor predictor of plant reproductive success, particularly when there are trade-offs between visit quantity and components of visit quality. For example, the duration of pollinator visits may be negatively correlated with the number of visits received by a flower. We tested for a trade-off between the number of bumblebee visits and the duration of those visits in an experimental population of snapdragons (Antirrhinummajus: Scrophulariaceae). The duration of a bumblebee visit to a flower increased significantly with the time interval since the flower had last been visited. Over the lifetime of a flower the correlation between the total number and average duration of visits received by a flower was weakly negative. However, at the whole-plant level the correlation was positive: plants whose flowers received more visits also received visits of longer duration. Factors affecting the relationship between quantity and duration of pollinator visits to flowers also were investigated. Two factors weakened the negative dependence of average visit duration on number of visits received by individual snapdragon flowers: (1) the correlation between the total number of visits to a flower and the average interval between visits was only −0.53, as visits to individual flowers were not very evenly spaced over time, and (2) newly opened flowers received fewer and shorter visits than older flowers. Comparing whole plants, nectar production per flower varied dramatically across individuals, a probable explanation for the positive correlation between visit number and average duration per flower observed at the plant level. The potential for a trade-off between these two components of pollinator service exists when visit duration depends on reward quantity; whether the trade-off is realized will depend on variation in nectar production and on whether pollinators forage systematically.},

	abstract = {Selection for specialized coevolutionary relationships can arise if generalized opportunistic pollinators, while still delivering some pollen, operate as less effective pollen delivery agents. Nevertheless, generalization could buffer high-latitude communities from loss of specialist pollinator species by providing some pollination service. Currently, there is limited understanding of the ecosystem services provided by generalized pollinators and whether they increase the fitness of the plants they visit. Network data and thorough observations of floral visitors, paired with estimates of seed set, offer some insight into the role of generalists, which in turn can inform us about how plants are likely to respond to ecosystem disturbances, such as losses of some pollinators, or changes in land cover. Here, we report on a plant-pollinator visitation networks in Canada with high levels of generalization and examine the effects of generalization on seed set under different disturbance histories. We also then take a case study of one crop wild relative, Rubus arcticus or Arctic raspberry, and report on a near-complete characterization of pollinator interactions in different environmental conditions. Our findings indicate that generalized pollinators, though frequent and robust to variable temperatures and moisture conditions, do not appear to play a strong role in increasing the reproductive output of many plant species, and may provide only a weak buffer against the stronger effects of disturbance.},

	abstract = {Many plants express their female and male sex roles at different times (dichogamy), with important consequences for mating. Dichogamy can yield mate limitation via biased floral sex ratios, particularly at the beginning and end of the flowering season when many plants simultaneously function as the same sex. This form of mate limitation should be reduced if plants adjust their allocations to female versus male sex functions in a manner that tracks seasonal variability in mating opportunities. For example, under protogyny (i.e. dichogamy with female function expressed first) plants with male-biased sex expression should have enhanced mating opportunities early in the flowering season as other plants begin to flower (in female sex phase). We quantified seasonal changes in sex allocation, patterns of mate availability and realized siring success in a population of protogynous Sagittaria latifolia. Our results were consistent with previous findings that seasonal changes in sex allocation should compensate for lost mating opportunities under the temporally variable mating environments caused by dichogamy. However, patterns of siring success in the population were inconsistent with this interpretation. We suggest that realized siring success might depend more strongly on spatial than on temporal aspects of mate availability.},

Such apparent maladaptation may result from conflicting selection through male and female sexual functions in hermaphrodites. We studied sex-specific mating patterns and phenotypic selection on floral traits in Aconitum gymnandrum. After genotyping 1786 offspring, we partitioned individual fitness into sex-specific selfed and outcrossed components and estimated phenotypic selection acting through each. Relative fitness increased with increasing mate number, and more so for male function. This led to greater opportunity for selection through outcrossed male fitness, though patterns of phenotypic selection on floral traits tended to be similar, and with better support for selection through female rather than male fitness components. We detected directional selection through one or more fitness component for larger flower number, larger flowers, and more negative nectar gradients within inflorescences. Our results are consistent with Bateman's principles for sex-specific mating patterns and illustrate that, despite the expected difference in opportunity for selection, patterns of variation in selection across traits can be rather similar for the male and female sexual functions. These results shed new light on the effect of sexual selection on the evolution of floral traits.},

	abstract = {Reproductive systems of flowering plants are evolutionarily fluid, with mating patterns changing in response to shifts in abiotic conditions, pollination systems, and population characteristics. Changes in mating should be particularly evident in species with sexual polymorphisms that become ecologically destabilized, promoting transitions to alternative reproductive systems. Here, we decompose female mating portfolios (incidence of selfing, outcross mate number, and intermorph mating) in eight populations of Primula oreodoxa, a self-compatible insect-pollinated herb. This species is ancestrally distylous, with populations subdivided into two floral morphs that usually mate with each other (disassortative mating). Stages in the breakdown of polymorphism also occur, including “mixed” populations of distylous and homostylous (self-pollinating) morphs and purely homostylous populations. Population morph ratios vary with elevation in association with differences in pollinator availability, providing an unusual opportunity to investigate changes in mating patterns accompanying transitions in reproductive systems. Unexpectedly, individuals mostly outcrossed randomly, with substantial disassortative mating in at most two distylous populations. As predicted, mixed populations had higher selfing rates than distylous populations, within mixed populations, homostyles selfed almost twice as much as the distylous morphs, and homostylous populations exhibited the highest selfing rates. Populations with homostyles outcrossed with fewer mates and mate number varied negatively with population selfing rates. These differences indicate maintenance of distyly at low elevation, transition to monomorphic selfing at high elevation, and uncertain, possibly variable fates at intermediate elevation. By quantifying the earliest changes in mating that initiate reproductive transitions, our study highlights the key role of mating in promoting evolutionary divergence.},

Previous research has suggested that restricted seed and pollen dispersal in populations resulted in strong spatial genetic structure. We used microsatellites to genotype young plants and their potential parents at four sites across the species’ entire natural range. We determined the most likely parents of each young plant based on the spatial separation of each parent pair, their genetic relatedness, and the level of correlated paternity. We identified both parents (43 female, 54 male) for 139 of 493 young plants. Mean distance between parental pairs was 26.8 m. Correlated paternity was low (0.168), indicating that mother trees were often pollinated by several fathers. Parental pairs were more closely related than expected by chance, suggesting outbreeding depression. Our results highlight the apparent strong mate choice for close kin in parent pairs of surviving offspring. We discuss the alternative biological processes that could lead to this, including the potential for break-up of favourable allelic combinations necessary for the development of the palm’s very large seed. Management implications include germinating seeds where they naturally fall, using a diverse range of male plants as pollen donors for hand pollination, and protecting the native community of gecko pollinators.},

	abstract = {Premise The relative per-flower production of ovules and pollen varies broadly with angiosperm mating systems, with outcrossing types commonly producing more pollen grains per ovule than selfing types. The evolutionary causes of this variation are contentious, especially the relevance of pollination risk. Resolution of this debate may have been hampered by its focus on pollen:ovule (P:O) ratios rather than on the evolution of pollen and ovule numbers per se. Methods Using published mean ovule and pollen counts, we analyzed associations with the proportion of removed pollen that reaches stigmas (pollen-transfer efficiency) and differences between pollinator-dependent and autogamous forms within and among species. Analyses involved Bayesian methods that simultaneously considered variation in pollen and ovule numbers and accounted for phylogenetic relatedness. We also assessed the utility of P:O ratios as mating-system proxies and their association with female outcrossing rates. Results Median pollen number declined consistently with pollen-transfer efficiency among species, whereas median ovule number did not. Similarly, in both intraspecific and interspecific analyses, pollinator-dependent plants produced more pollen than autogamous plants, whereas ovule production did not differ statistically. Distributions of P:O ratios overlapped extensively for self-incompatible and self-compatible species and for different mating-system classes, and P:O ratios correlated weakly with outcrossing rate. Conclusions Our findings demonstrate that pollinator dependence and pollination efficiency commonly influence the evolution of pollen number per flower but have more limited effects on ovule number. P:O ratios provide ambiguous, possibly misleading, information about mating systems, especially when compared among clades.},

	abstract = {In ecological speciation, incipient species diverge due to natural selection that is ecologically based. In flowering plants, different pollinators could mediate that selection (pollinator-mediated divergent selection) or other features of the environment that differ between habitats of 2 species could do so (environment-mediated divergent selection). Although these mechanisms are well understood, they have received little rigorous testing, as few studies of divergent selection across sites of closely related species include both floral traits that influence pollination and vegetative traits that influence survival. This study employed common gardens in sites of the 2 parental species and a hybrid site, each containing advanced generation hybrids along with the parental species, to test these forms of ecological speciation in plants of the genus Ipomopsis. A total of 3 vegetative traits (specific leaf area, leaf trichomes, and photosynthetic water-use efficiency) and 5 floral traits (corolla length and width, anther insertion, petal color, and nectar production) were analyzed for impacts on fitness components (survival to flowering and seeds per flower, respectively). These traits exhibited strong clines across the elevational gradient in the hybrid zone, with narrower clines in theory reflecting stronger selection or higher genetic variance. Plants with long corollas and inserted anthers had higher seeds per flower at the Ipomopsis tenuituba site, whereas selection favored the reverse condition at the Ipomopsis aggregata site, a signature of divergent selection. In contrast, no divergent selection due to variation in survival was detected on any vegetative trait. Selection within the hybrid zone most closely resembled selection within the I. aggregata site. Across traits, the strength of divergent selection was not significantly correlated with width of the cline, which was better predicted by evolvability (standardized genetic variance). These results support the role of pollinator-mediated divergent selection in ecological speciation and illustrate the importance of genetic variance in determining divergence across hybrid zones.The remarkable diversity of the flowering plants has been attributed to evolutionary effects of pollinators since the time of Darwin. Despite that long history, there are few tests of whether differences in appearance between closely related plant species reflect adaptation to different animal pollinators or adaptation to other differences between habitats such as soil types or climatic conditions. This study examines the relationships of plant traits to fitness in field gardens planted with two closely related species of subalpine plants and their hybrids. It presents strong evidence that divergence between the two species is driven by pollinator-mediated natural selection rather than habitat-mediated selection. It focuses on both floral and vegetative traits that show clines, i.e., gradual changes in trait value, across an elevational gradient. Natural selection due to differences in seed production favored long flowers in the site occupied by slender skyrocket (Ipomopsis tenuituba) but short flowers in the site occupied by scarlet gilia (Ipomopsis aggregata), a signature of divergent selection mediated by pollinators. Similar results were obtained for another reproductive trait, position of the anthers. In contrast, vegetative traits (leaf thickness, leaf hairs, and water-use efficiency during photosynthesis) did not experience divergent selection across the parental sites, thus providing no support for habitat-mediated selection. Across all measured traits, the strength of divergent selection did not correlate with the steepness of the cline, as frequently assumed, which was better predicted by the relative amount of genetic variability in the trait and thus its potential to evolve. Results elucidate the mechanism of plant speciation between these two species. They also illustrate the importance of combining data on spatial patterns in traits and natural selection measurements to understand how species diverge in nature.},

	abstract = {Identifying plant sexual dimorphic traits is critical in advancing our knowledge on plant–pollinator interactions. For example, dimorphism in floral colors, or sexual dichromatism, is a crucial mediator of pollinator choice on foraging decisions. We studied Cylindropuntia wolfii, a model system, with diverse flower colors and a functionally dioecious sexual system. However, evidence suggests that sexual reproduction is limited in this species as it has a low seed set especially in naturally pollinated fruits. Thus, it is critical to this native species’ conservation to investigate its relationship with pollinators. Our goals were to: (a) investigate the sexual dimorphism including the sexual dichromatism in the flowers of the cactus, and (b) determine whether sexually dimorphic traits affect the pollinator attraction of both the sexes. We measured several quantitative and qualitative traits and compared them between male and female flowers. Then we recorded the pollinator visitation rate in nature for both sexes and tracked pollinator color preference using fluorescent dyes as pollen analogues. Our study showed that male flowers of C. wolfii are bigger and brighter, and they attract more potential pollinators than females, supporting the hypothesis that sexual dimorphism influences pollinator visitation preference. Fluorescence dichromatism, in which female flowers’ anthers fluoresce more than male flower anthers suggest this could be female flowers’ strategy to compensate for their dark colors and small size. The results from this study showed that C. wolfii exhibits sexual dichromatism and fluorescence dichromatism, which is a novel finding in plant research.},

Here, we discuss recent advances in the understanding of three distinct SI mechanisms, each controlled by two separate determinant genes at the S-locus. In the Brassicaceae, the determinant genes encode a pollen ligand and its stigmatic receptor kinase; their interaction induces incompatible signaling(s) within the stigma papilla cells. In the Solanaceae-type SI, the determinants are a ribonuclease and an F-box protein, suggesting the involvement of RNA and protein degradation in the system. In the Papaveraceae, the only identified female determinant induces a Ca2+-dependent signaling network that ultimately results in the death of incompatible pollen.},

This is surprising, because both of the two key modes of sexual selection, male-male competition and female choice, could plausibly operate during pollen-pistil interactions where physical male-female contact occurs. Here, we consider how the key processes of sexual selection might affect traits involved in pollen-pistil interactions, including 'Fisherian runaway' and 'good-genes' models. We review aspects of the molecular and cellular biology of pollen-pistil interactions on which sexual selection could act and point to research that is needed to investigate them.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection operates on a sequence of events, from mating to offspring production. Which stages in this sequence undergo stronger selection, especially the relative importance of pre- versus postcopulatory processes, are intensely debated issues. Unequal siring success among mates of polyandrous females is classically taken as evidence for a large contribution of postcopulatory processes to the variance in male reproductive success (var(RSm)). However, paternity skews also depend on the timing and number of copulations, a source of variation that should be considered precopulatory rather than postcopulatory. We develop a method for decomposing var(RSm) accounting for copulatory activity and apply it to experimental mating groups of the snail Physa acuta. In our experiment, 40\% of var(RSm) emerges at the precopulatory stage, only half of which depends on variation in mating success (number of partners). Ignoring copulation characteristics can therefore lead to severe underestimation of precopulatory sexual selection. Moreover, although only 36\% of var(RSm) arises at the postcopulatory stage, this is when sexual selection on body weight mostly occurs. Finally, trade-offs were detected between different components of precopulatory success, whereas pre- and postcopulatory success appear independent. Our study opens the way to a detailed quantitative understanding of sexual selection in polyandrous species.},

Pollen transfer of the four most common pollinating bee species and one nectar-robbing bee of the distylous plant Gelsemium sempervirens were compared., • Methods Naturally occurring pollen loads carried by the common floral visitor species of G. sempervirens were compared. In addition, dyed pollen donor flowers and sequences of four emasculated recipient flowers in field cages were used to estimate pollen transfer, and the utility of fluorescent dye powder as an analogue for pollen transfer was determined., • Key Results Xylocopa virginica, Osmia lignaria and Habropoda laboriosa carried the most G. sempervirens pollen on their bodies, followed by Bombus bimaculatus and Apis mellifera. However, B. bimaculatus, O. lignaria and H. laboriosa transferred significantly more pollen than A. mellifera. Nectar-robbing X. virginica transferred the least pollen, even when visiting legitimately. Dye particles were strongly correlated with pollen grains on a stigma, and therefore provide a good analogue for pollen in this system. The ratio of pollen : dye across stigmas was not affected by bee species or interactions between bee species and floral morphology. However, dye transfer was more sensitive than pollen transfer to differences in floral morphology., • Conclusions The results from this study add to a growing body of literature highlighting that floral visitors vary in pollination effectiveness, and that visitors carrying the most pollen on their bodies may not always be the most efficient at depositing pollen on stigmas. Understanding the magnitude of variability in pollinator quality is one important factor for predicting how different pollinator taxa may influence the evolution of floral traits.},

	abstract = {Bateman’s principle has been widely interpreted to imply that females gain no fitness benefits from polyandry (Bateman, 1948) and, therefore, should not be expected to mate multiply (here defined as mating with more than one male). Nevertheless, it is increasingly clear that females of many, if not most, taxa do copulate with multiple males (e.g. Birkhead and Wier, 1998). Moreover, polyandry is widespread despite considerable costs, including wasted time and energy, increased risk of predation and disease, potential damage caused by male seminal fluids and copulatory organs, and even death (Keller and Reeve, 1995; Eberhard, 1996). Despite these associated costs, females of diverse taxa not only accept several mates but also actively solicit multiple copulations in many instances (Birkhead and Moller, 1998). As evidence of diverse potential benefits associated with polyandry now accumulates, the assumption that females should not mate multiply because they cannot increase offspring numbers by doing so appears questionable. Importantly, since females have greater potential than males to influence the quality of their offspring, and investment in current reproduction has consequences for future reproductive attempts, they should be expected to optimise offspring numbers rather than maximise numbers produced in any given reproductive attempt (Roff, 1992; Stearns, 1992). Moreover, the relationship between female lifetime reproductive success and offspring numbers and/or size may not be as straightforward as is generally assumed (e.g. Madsen and Shine, 1998; Stockley and Macdonald, 1998). To suggest that females should not mate multiply simply because they cannot increase offspring numbers in a given reproductive attempt by doing so is therefore to confuse the currency of male and female fitness, and thereby to considerably under-estimate the complexity of female reproductive strategies.},

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence has begun to reveal flaws in the traditional assumption of female passivity and lack of discrimination after copulation has begun. William Eberhard has compiled an impressive array of research on the ability of females to shape the outcome of mating. He describes studies of many different cryptic mechanisms by which a female can accept a male for copulation but nevertheless reject him as a father. Evidence from various fields indicates that such selectivity by females may be the norm rather than the exception. Because most post-copulatory competition between males for paternity is played out within the bodies of females, female behavior, morphology, and physiology probably often influence male success in these contests. Eberhard draws examples from a diversity of organisms, ranging from ctenophores to scorpions, nematodes to frogs, and crickets to humans.     Cryptic female choice establishes a new bridge between sexual selection theory and reproductive physiology, in particular the physiological effects of male seminal products on female reproductive processes, such as sperm transport, oviposition, and remating. Eberhard interweaves his review of previous studies with speculation on the consequences of this theoretical development, and indicates promising new directions for future research.},

Over the last decades a body of evolutionary theory, sex allocation theory, was developed, which has yielded capital insight into the evolution of optimal sex allocation patterns and adaptive evolution in general. Most empirical work, however, has focused on species with separate sexes. Here I review sex allocation theory for simultaneous hermaphrodites and summarize over 50 empirical studies, which have aimed at evaluating this theory in a diversity of simultaneous hermaphrodites spanning nine animal phyla. These studies have yielded considerable qualitative support for several predictions of sex allocation theory, such as a female-biased sex allocation when the number of mates is limited, and a shift toward a more male-biased sex allocation with increasing numbers of mates. In contrast, many fundamental assumptions, such as the trade-off between male and female allocation, and numerous predictions, such as brooding limiting the returns from female allocation, are still poorly supported. Measuring sex allocation in simultaneously hermaphroditic animals remains experimentally demanding, which renders evaluation of more quantitative predictions a challenging task. I identify the main questions that need to be addressed and point to promising avenues for future research.},

	abstract = {Measuring pollinator performance has become increasingly important with emerging needs for risk assessment in conservation and sustainable agriculture that require multi-year and multi-site comparisons across studies. However, comparing pollinator performance across studies is difficult because of the diversity of concepts and disparate methods in use. Our review of the literature shows many unresolved ambiguities. Two different assessment concepts predominate: the first estimates stigmatic pollen deposition and the underlying pollinator behaviour parameters, while the second estimates the pollinator's contribution to plant reproductive success, for example in terms of seed set. Both concepts include a number of parameters combined in diverse ways and named under a diversity of synonyms and homonyms. However, these concepts are overlapping because pollen deposition success is the most frequently used proxy for assessing the pollinator's contribution to plant reproductive success. We analyse the diverse concepts and methods in the context of a new proposed conceptual framework with a modular approach based on pollen deposition, visit frequency, and contribution to seed set relative to the plant's maximum female reproductive potential. A system of equations is proposed to optimize the balance between idealised theoretical concepts and practical operational methods. Our framework permits comparisons over a range of floral phenotypes, and spatial and temporal scales, because scaling up is based on the same fundamental unit of analysis, the single visit.},

Conversely, both honey bees and bumblebees,Bombusspp., can mark rewarding flowers with scent marks that promote probing by conspecifics. We examined detection of recently visited flowers in a mixed community of bumblebees foraging on comfrey,Symphytum officinale, in southern England. When foraging among inflorescences on a plant, three abundant species ofBombusprobed fewer inflorescences more than once than would be expected from random foraging. Bees frequently encountered inflorescences but departed without probing them for nectar. Examination of the incidence of such rejections in the two most common species,B.terrestrisandB.pascuorum, revealed that the low incidence of multiple probing visits was due to two factors: bees both foraged systematically and selectively rejected inflorescences that they had previously visited. When presented with inflorescences of known history, bees selectively rejected those that had been recently visited by themselves or by conspecifics compared with randomly selected inflorescences. They were also able to distinguish inflorescences that had been visited by otherBombusspecies. Bees were unable to distinguish and reject inflorescences from which the nectar had been removed artificially. We conclude that theseBombusspecies are probably using scent marks left by previous visitors. The significance of deposition and detection of interspecific scent marks for competitive interactions between species is discussed.},

We measured the magnitude of sexual selection in a monoecious and a dioecious population of the clonal plant Sagittaria latifolia using Bateman gradients ( ß ss ). These gradients were calculated using parentage analysis and residual regression to account for the effects of shoot and clone size on mating and reproductive success. In both populations, (i) there was greater promiscuity via male function than via female function and (ii) ß ss were positive, with significant associations between mating and reproductive success for male but not female function. Moreover, estimated β ss were similar for the monoecious and dioecious populations, possibly because non-overlapping female and male sex phases in hermaphroditic S. latifolia reduced the scope for interference between sex functions during mating. This study builds on previous studies of selection on plant mating traits, and of sexual selection under experimental conditions, by showing that sexual selection can operate in natural populations of plants, including populations of hermaphrodites.},

	abstract = {Bateman's principles continue to play a major role in the characterization of genetic mating systems in natural populations. The modern manifestations of Bateman's ideas include the opportunity for sexual selection (i.e. Is – the variance in relative mating success), the opportunity for selection (i.e. I – the variance in relative reproductive success) and the Bateman gradient (i.e. βss – the slope of the least-squares regression of reproductive success on mating success). These variables serve as the foundation for one convenient approach for the quantification of mating systems. However, their estimation presents at least two challenges, which I address here with a new Windows-based computer software package called batemanater. The first challenge is that confidence intervals for these variables are not easy to calculate. batemanater solves this problem using a bootstrapping approach. The second, more serious, problem is that direct estimates of mating system variables from open populations will typically be biased if some potential progeny or adults are missing from the analysed sample. batemanater addresses this problem using a maximum-likelihood approach to estimate mating system variables from incompletely sampled breeding populations. The current version of batemanater addresses the problem for systems in which progeny can be collected in groups of half- or full-siblings, as would occur when eggs are laid in discrete masses or offspring occur in pregnant females. batemanater has a user-friendly graphical interface and thus represents a new, convenient tool for the characterization and comparison of genetic mating systems.},

	abstract = {The field of post-copulatory sexual selection investigates how female and male adaptations have evolved to influence the fertilization of eggs while optimizing fitness during and after copulation, when females mate with multiple males. When females are polyandrous (one female mates with multiple males), they may optimize their mating rate and control the outcome of mating interactions to acquire direct and indirect benefits. Polyandry may also favor the evolution of male traits that offer an advantage in post-copulatory male-male sperm competition. Sperm competition occurs when the sperm, seminal fluid, and/or genitalia of one male directly impacts the outcome of fertilization success of a rival male. When a female mates with multiple males, she may use information from a number of traits to choose who will sire her offspring. This cryptic female choice (CFC) to bias paternity can be based on behavioral, physiological, and morphological criteria (e.g., copulatory courtship, volume and/or composition of seminal fluid, shape of grasping appendages). Because male fitness interests are rarely perfectly aligned with female fitness interests, sexual conflict over mating and fertilization commonly occur during copulatory and post-copulatory interactions. Post-copulatory interactions inherently involve close associations between female and male reproductive characteristics, which in many species potentially include sperm storage and sperm movement inside the female reproductive tract, and highlight the intricate coevolution between the sexes. This coevolution is also common in genital morphology. The great diversity of genitalia among species is attributed to sexual selection. The evolution of genital attributes that allow females to maintain reproductive autonomy over paternity via cryptic female choice or that prevent male manipulation and sexual control via sexually antagonistic coevolution have been well documented. Additionally, cases where genitalia evolve through intrasexual competition are well known. Another important area of study in post-copulatory sexual selection is the examination of trade-offs between investments in pre-copulatory and post-copulatory traits, since organisms have limited energetic resources to allocate to reproduction, and securing both mating and fertilization is essential for reproductive success.},

	abstract = {The evolution of floral traits is often attributed to pollinator‐mediated selection; however, the importance of pollinators as selective agents in arctic environments is poorly resolved. In arctic and subarctic regions that are thought to be pollen limited, selection is expected to either favor floral traits that increase pollinator attraction or promote reproductive assurance through selfing. We quantified phenotypic selection on floral traits in two arctic and two subarctic populations of the self‐compatible, but largely pollinator‐dependent, Parrya nudicaulis. Additionally, we measured selection in plants in both open pollination and pollen augmentation treatments to estimate selection imposed by pollinators in one population. Seed production was found to be limited by pollen availability and strong directional selection on flower number was observed. We did not detect consistently greater magnitudes of selection on floral traits in the arctic relative to the subarctic populations. Directional selection for more pigmented flowers in one arctic population was observed, however. In some populations, selection on flower color was found to interact with other traits. We did not detect consistently stronger selection gradients across all traits for plants exposed to pollinator selection relative to those in the pollen augmentation treatment; however, directional selection tended to be higher for some floral traits in open‐pollinated plants. We quantified phenotypic selection on floral traits in two arctic and two subarctic populations of Parrya nudicaulis, and measured selection in plants in both open pollination and pollen augmentation treatments to estimate selection imposed by pollinators. Seed production was pollen limited; however, strength of selection on floral traits exposed to pollinator‐mediated selection was not consistently greater, and selection in the Arctic populations was not consistently greater.},

By contrast, nursery pollination of certain Caryophyllaceae, including Silene spp., by two nocturnal moth genera, Hadena and Perizoma, ranges from antagonistic to potentially mutualistic, offering an opportunity to test hypotheses about the factors that promote or discourage the evolution of mutualism. Here, we review nursery pollination and host–plant interactions in over 30 caryophyllaceous plants, based on published studies and a survey of researchers investigating pollination, seed predation, and moth morphology and behavior.

	abstract = {Nursery pollination interactions are widespread between Caryophyllaceae species and the pollinating-seed predator Hadena moths (Noctuidae). A previous revision of this system was based mainly on widely distributed species in the north and center of Europe. However, there was no information from the Mediterranean region, one of the global diversification centers of both taxa. The aim of this work is to review the progress on the knowledge of this nursery pollination system since the first revision, providing unpublished data of Caryophyllaceae-Hadena associations from Spain. Furthermore, we conduct a preliminary network analysis to illustrate the advantages of this approach to explore nursery pollination systems. In the last 10 years, most of studies have focused on selective forces exerted by Hadena on the plant reproductive traits through pollination and predation. Hadena moths are selectively attracted by flower scents, flower sizes and number of flowers per plant are also crucial for attraction of the moths. Caryophyllaceae species may have developed some phenological, chemical, morphogical and physiological adaptations to avoid overexploitation by larvae. The evolution of sexual dimorphism in Caryophyllaceae may be a consequence of mutualistic and antagonistic interactions. Other pollinators as well as an anther smut fungus and larval parasitoids are important selective agents that can shift this interaction between mutualism and parasitism. Whereas most studies highlighted the parasitic nature of the Hadena-Caryophyllaceae interaction, we need further analyses on the pollinator effectiveness of Hadena and on the spatio-temporal variation of the interaction outcome. Based on our field surveys and bibliographic records we found evidence of nursery pollination between 22 noctuid species (mostly Hadena) and 70 Caryophyllaceae species from 11 genera (mostly Silene and Dianthus). From these interactions, 26 were new for the Iberian Peninsula and 18 were not described before. Results of our preliminary network analysis suggest that these interactions are constrained by phylogenetic, geographical and ecological filters.},

The flowers showed a nocturnal rhythm, and scent was emitted only at night. The amount of emitted volatiles varied greatly during the season, from 400 ng/flower/2 min in June to 50 ng/flower/2 min in August and September. The qualitative variability in the floral scent was high and different chemotypes, characterised by specific scent compounds, were found. Female and male flowers emitted the same type and amount of volatiles. The differences in floral scent composition between European and North American populations were small. Typical compounds were isoprenoids like lilac aldehyde isomers, or trans-β-ocimene, and benzenoids like benzaldehyde, phenyl acetaldehyde, or veratrole. Some of these compounds are known to attract nocturnal Lepidoptera species.

	abstract = {Considering both pollinator and herbivore pressures on plant reproductive and defensive traits is key to understanding patterns of selection for plants. However, phenotypic selection studies connecting floral traits and plant defenses with pollinator activity and herbivore damage remain rare. We used the common milkweed, Asclepias syriaca (Apocynaceae), to study phenotypic selection on attractive and defensive traits, and nectar rewards. We measured herbivore (leaf damage) and pollinator activity (pollinia movement) and quantified selection via female (pollinia insertions and fruit number) and male fitness (pollinia removals). We found selection to increase plant and inflorescence size and to decrease floral size (i.e. petal width) via female fitness. We also detected selection to increase floral but not leaf latex. The lack of selection on leaf latex was congruent with the low herbivory observed, however we also did not observe florivory in the population that would explain the advantage of more floral latex. Interestingly, we found selection on attractive traits differed via pollinia insertions and fruits initiated, suggesting that something other than pollinators was driving selection via fruit production. In contrast to female fitness, we did not find selection on any trait through male fitness, suggesting no sexual conflicting selection, at least through these proxies. Our findings reinforce the importance of the direct assessment of pollinator pressures in phenotypic selection studies before assuming pollinators as drivers of floral evolution by natural selection. Further work in southern populations closer to the centre of the species range, where herbivory and plant defense investment are higher, may help elucidate selection on attractive and defensive traits.},

This paper aims at characterizing rapid evolution of life history traits and floral traits over two decades in the wild pansy (Viola arvensis), a common weed in agrosystems. Methods We used a resurrection ecology approach with genotypes sampled in 1991 and 2012 from a population in Burgundy (France). The species has a mixed mating system (hereafter: mixed selfer) and presents a floral polymorphism. To correct for maternal effects, we measured plant traits in the second generation in a common garden (after a refreshing generation) to characterize plant evolution during the two decades. In addition, historical population selfing rates in 1991 and 2012 were inferred from microsatellites markers through heterozygote deficiency and identity disequilibrium. Results Phenotypic data revealed a significant advance in flowering date, reduced flower sizes and a higher propensity of plants to set seed by autonomous selfing. Moreover, we detected a change in color morph frequency with an increase of the pale morph frequency. In accordance with phenotypic data, the neutral genetic data revealed an increase in historical selfing rates from 0.68 in 1991 to 0.86 in 2012. Conclusions Taken together, such data suggest that the wild pansy, a mixed selfer, is evolving a selfing syndrome that may be the consequence of reduced pollinator activity in agrosystems.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection has been a popular subject within evolutionary biology because of its central role in explaining odd and counterintuitive traits observed in nature. Consequently, the literature associated with this field of study became vast. Meta-analytical studies attempting to draw inferences from this literature have now accumulated, varying in scope and quality, thus calling for a synthesis of these syntheses. We conducted a systematic literature search to create a systematic map with a report appraisal of meta-analyses on topics associated with sexual selection, aiming to identify the conceptual and methodological gaps in this secondary literature. We also conducted bibliometric analyses to explore whether these gaps are associated with the gender and origin of the authors of these meta-analyses. We included 152 meta-analytical studies in our systematic map. We found that most meta-analyses focused on males and on certain animal groups (e.g. birds), indicating severe sex and taxonomic biases. The topics in these studies varied greatly, from proximate (e.g. relationship of ornaments with other traits) to ultimate questions (e.g. formal estimates of sexual selection strength), although the former were more common. We also observed several common methodological issues in these studies, such as lack of detailed information regarding searches, screening, and analyses, which ultimately impairs the reliability of many of these meta-analyses. In addition, most of the meta-analyses' authors were men affiliated to institutions from developed countries, pointing to both gender and geographical authorship biases. Most importantly, we found that certain authorship aspects were associated with conceptual and methodological issues in meta-analytical studies. Many of our findings might simply reflect patterns in the current state of the primary literature and academia, suggesting that our study can serve as an indicator of issues within the field of sexual selection at large. Based on our findings, we provide both conceptual and analytical recommendations to improve future studies in the field of sexual selection.},

However, the eco-evolutionary dynamics of sexual selection and their role for a population’s adaptive potential to respond to environmental change have only recently been explored. Theory predicts that sexual selection promotes adaptation at a low demographic cost only if sexual selection is aligned with natural selection and if net selection is stronger on males compared to females. We used a comparative approach to show that net selection is indeed stronger in males and provide preliminary support that this sex bias is associated with sexual selection. Given that both sexes share the vast majority of their genes, our findings corroborate the notion that the genome is often confronted with a more stressful environment when expressed in males. Collectively, our study supports one of the long-standing key assumptions required for sexual selection to bolster adaptation, and sexual selection may therefore enable some species to track environmental change more efficiently.},

The number of males in competition, the reproductive gains from investing in premating sexual traits, and the level of sperm competition are all predicted to influence how males allocate their finite resources to these traits. Yet, empirical examination of these predictions is currently scarce. Here, we studied relative expenditure on pre- and postmating sexual traits among frog species varying in their population density, operational sex ratio, and the number of competing males for each clutch of eggs. We found that the intensifying struggle to monopolize fertilizations as more and more males clasp the same female to fertilize her eggs shifts male reproductive investment toward sperm production and away from male weaponry. This shift, which is mediated by population density and the associated level of male–male competition, likely also explains the trade-off between pre- and postmating sexual traits in our much broader sample of anuran species. Our results highlight the power of such a multilevel approach in resolving the evolution of traits and allocation trade-offs.},

The interaction between pre- and postmating episodes of selection is expected to be context dependent, but few studies have investigated how total sexual selection changes under different ecological conditions. We examined how population density mediates the interaction between pre- and postmating sexual selection by establishing replicate populations of the horned dung beetle Onthophagus taurus at low, medium, and high densities, and then using microsatellite-based parentage analyses to measure male fitness. We found that mating success and fertilization success were positively correlated at all three densities, but the strength of the correlation decreased with increasing density. We also found a shift from negative to positive linear selection on testes mass as density increased, and opposing selection on weapons and testes at high densities. These patterns suggest that the importance of postmating processes increases with increasing population density, which reduces the selective advantage of weapons for premating contest competition, and increases the selective advantage of large ejaculates for postmating sperm competition. We expect that density-dependent selection on testes mass has contributed to the phenotypic variation observed between natural populations of O. taurus that differ in density.},

An interesting ecological condition is population density, which can either increase or decrease sexual selection depending on the natural history of the species. We examined sexual and natural selection in an undescribed amphipod species (Hyalella sp.) using surveys of two natural populations that increase in density from spring to summer. We also conducted an experiment that directly manipulated density to assess the effects on sexual selection. In the field during spring (low density) and summer (high density), we documented sexual selection on male traits, including body size, gnathopods and antennae. We found that the magnitude and direction of this selection changed from spring to summer and that selection patterns differed between populations. In the experiment, we found no sexual selection occurred at low density, but found significant positive selection on all three male traits at medium and high densities. These results underline the importance of isolating individual ecological factors to determine their role in sexual selection while also documenting patterns in natural populations to understand how selection varies over space and time.},

	abstract = {Sexual selection operates on a sequence of events, from mating to offspring production. Which stages in this sequence undergo stronger selection, especially the relative importance of pre- versus postcopulatory processes, are intensely debated issues. Unequal siring success among mates of polyandrous females is classically taken as evidence for a large contribution of postcopulatory processes to the variance in male reproductive success (var(RSm)). However, paternity skews also depend on the timing and number of copulations, a source of variation that should be considered precopulatory rather than postcopulatory. We develop a method for decomposing var(RSm) accounting for copulatory activity and apply it to experimental mating groups of the snail Physa acuta. In our experiment, 40\% of var(RSm) emerges at the precopulatory stage, only half of which depends on variation in mating success (number of partners). Ignoring copulation characteristics can therefore lead to severe underestimation of precopulatory sexual selection. Moreover, although only 36\% of var(RSm) arises at the postcopulatory stage, this is when sexual selection on body weight mostly occurs. Finally, trade-offs were detected between different components of precopulatory success, whereas pre- and postcopulatory success appear independent. Our study opens the way to a detailed quantitative understanding of sexual selection in polyandrous species.},

	abstract = {PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Although much attention has focused on the diversity of plant mating systems, only a few studies have considered the joint effects of mating system and sexual conflict in plant evolution. In mixed-mating Collinsia heterophylla, a sexual conflict over timing of stigma receptivity is proposed: pollen with a capacity to induce early onset of stigma receptivity secures paternity for early-arriving pollen (at the expense of reduced maternal seed set), whereas late onset of stigma receptivity mitigates the negative effects of early-arriving pollen. Here we investigated whether selection on pollen and pistil traits involved in sexual conflict is affected by the presence of both outcross- and self-pollen (mixed mating) during pollen competition. METHODS: We conducted two-donor crosses at different floral developmental stages to explore male fitness (siring ability) and female fitness (seed set) in relation to male and female identity, pollen and pistil traits, and type of competitor pollen (outcross vs. self). KEY RESULTS: Late-fertilizing pollen rather than rapidly growing pollen tubes was most successful in terms of siring success, especially in competition with self-pollen after pollination at early floral stages. Late stigma receptivity increased seed set after early-stage pollinations, in agreement with selection against antagonistic pollen. CONCLUSIONS: Selection on pollen and pistil traits in C. heterophylla is affected by both sexual conflict and mixed mating, suggesting the importance of jointly considering these factors in plant evolution.},

	abstract = {Polyandry, when females mate with more than one male, is theorised to play an important role in successful colonisation of new habitats. In addition to possible benefits from sexual selection, even mild polyandry could facilitate colonisation by protecting against inbreeding and reducing the costs of mating with incompatible or infertile males. Here, we measure the importance of mild polyandry for population viability and reproductive fitness following experimental founder events into a higher-temperature regime. Using colonisation experiments with the model beetle Tribolium castaneum, in which females can produce offspring for up to 140 days following a single mating, we founded more than 100 replicate populations using single females that had been given the opportunity to mate with either one or two males and then tracked their subsequent population dynamics. Following population viability and fitness across 10 generations, we found that extinction rates were significantly lower in populations founded by females given polyandrous opportunities to mate with two males (9\%) compared to populations founded by monogamous females (34\%). In addition, populations founded by females that had been provided with opportunities to store sperm from two different males showed double the median productivity following colonisation compared to monogamous-founded populations. Notably, we identified short-term and longer-term benefits to post-colonisation populations from double-mating, with results suggesting that polyandry acts to both protect against mating with incompatible males through the founder event, and reduce inbreeding depression as the colonisation proceeds for 10 generations. Our results therefore show that even mild polyandry provides both reproductive and genetic benefits for colonising populations.},

	abstract = {Multiple mating by females can dramatically alter selection on males by creating indirect interactions between rivals via sperm competition. Exactly how this behavior alters the relationship between male mating and fertilization success depends on multiple factors: re-mating frequency, sperm usage patterns, and mating assortment (the extent to which the most promiscuous individuals mate with each other). Here, we explore the role these elements play in determining sexual selection in a highly polygyandrous species, the squash bug Anasa tristis. Using replicated semi-natural enclosures, in which individuals were able to freely interact for a 2-week period, we tracked matings between individuals and subsequent female offspring production. Multiple mating was extremely common, resulting in very high levels of sperm competition intensity. However, network analysis revealed that the most promiscuous males mated with less polyandrous females, and therefore experienced lower levels of sperm competition. As a result, estimated male reproductive success increased with mating success, but this relationship varied according to the mode of sperm utilization with which it was calculated. Furthermore, females with more mating partners produced more offspring, suggesting they also benefit from mating multiply. Our findings highlight that polyandry has numerous and complex effects on sexual selection which may only be exposed when examined under naturalistic conditions.},

If those ideas survive testing, then they are considered ‘the truth’, or more crucially, truth-for-now, for the essence of science is that if a new idea provides a better explanation of the way the world is, the truth changes. Darwin's idea of evolution by natural selection, published as the Origin in 1859, replaced the earlier truth of physico- or natural-theology introduced by John Ray in 1691. Despite resistance by the church, Darwin's truth gained widespread acceptance, in part due to the efforts of T. H. Huxley, who on reading the Origin said ‘How extremely stupid not to have thought of that!’ Despite natural selection's enormous explanatory power, there were certain phenomena it apparently could not explain, including female promiscuity. It was only in the 1960s when natural selection was viewed as operating explicitly on individuals (rather than populations or groups), that this changed. Rather than being a cooperative venture between the sexes, sexual reproduction was now viewed in terms of conflicts of interests, and in so doing provided an explanation for female promiscuity (albeit in a male-biased sort of way). Until this point, sexual selection had been concerned exclusively with mate acquisition. With an evolutionary perspective focussing on individuals, it was recognized that sexual selection might continue after insemination, and that rather than competing for partners, males compete for fertilizations. Later it was acknowledged that females, through cryptic processes can also influence the outcome of sperm competition. Today, post-copulatory sexual selection provides explanations for many previously bewildering reproductive traits, including the extraordinary diversity in male and female genitalia, the design of spermatozoa and ova, of seminal fluid and of copulation behaviour itself},

	abstract = {Understanding the impact of demographic and ecological factors on the strength of sexual selection is pivotal to predict eco-evolutionary dynamics in populations facing environmental change. Density is expected to show pervasive intra- and interspecific variation in natural populations, but its effect on sexual selection remains largely unexplored. We tested experimentally the effect of density on standardized metrics of sexual selection in male and female red flour beetles. Specifically, we explored density effects during mating by manipulating the size of mating groups and the mating arena. We found that higher densities imposed by a larger group size amplified the opportunity for pre-copulatory sexual selection in females and, to a smaller extent, also in males. Moreover, in males, we detected a higher opportunity for post-copulatory sexual selection in larger groups. By contrast, higher densities imposed by differences in the size of the mating arena resulted in a steeper male sexual selection gradient. Overall, these data suggest that density is an important environmental factor contributing to the tremendous variation in the strength of sexual selection within and among species.

	volume = {292},
	doi = {10.1098/rspb.2024.2501},
	abstract = {The intensity and direction of sexual selection are intricately linked to the social and ecological context. Both operational sex ratios (OSRs) and population densities can affect the ability of males to monopolize resources and mates, and thus the form and intensity of sexual selection on them. Here, we studied how the mating system of the promiscuous and strongly sexually dimorphic fruit fly Drosophila prolongata responds to changes in the OSR and population density. We recorded groups of flies over five days and quantified territory occupancy, mating success (MS) and competitive fertilization success. Although sexual selection was stronger under male-biased than even OSRs but unrelated to density, realized selection on morphological traits was higher under even OSRs and increased with density. Larger and more territorial males achieved both higher MS and competitive fertilization success, but only under even OSRs. Our combined results also support a shift in the mating system from territorial contest competition to scramble competition under male-biased OSRs and potentially at low density, where there was no clear contribution of the measured traits to reproductive success. Our study emphasizes the limitations of traditional selection metrics and the role of the socio-ecological context in predicting adaptation to a changing environment.},
